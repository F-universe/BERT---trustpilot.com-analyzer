"I still like OFP just that if they can increase their consistency % and give regular discounts",

"The company is really excellent
But we have a note regarding Bitcoin Indicatorsand digital currencies, where the smallest possible transaction amount is one valid lot, and this is very large. We ask the company to allow the lot to be divided into 0.01 and 0.05, and so on.",

They will do everything to denny payout. Total scamm",

"I'm just recently bought an account from this firm. Haven't started trading yet, but so far everything is good.

"Dashboard is horrible as it does not produce live data. Accounts metrix does produce not real time data which causes Multiple false breaches. Discounts don't work (for me) and they stole money from me.

I have photographic proof of this Inconsistency rules are to their benefit not yours.

Rather pass a regular challenge

They do pay but your gonna waste a lot of money before making",

"From the company's page and its offerings I like the direction they're taking. Definitely have bright spots however I found some things such as the scaling plan to be missing off the site which would be good to look at it before making a decision to join. Also found customer service to be satisfactory but nothing great so it could be better, just being honest. But all in all I'd give the company a try.",

"Hi, Dejan here,

OFP is a very convenient trading firm

a lot of admins and support on discord, all day long.. also the website support is very quick and clear

for me, this human availability is the most important part of any business

ot feels very warm, thank you OFP for never leaving us hanging with questions

Dejan",

"So far am giving a 4 star rating because of the speed of the support and the good spreads they offer.

Commissions still can be reduced to help us maximise profits.
Also about the platforms Ctrader is fine, matchtrader is very poor, tradelocker is something I've yet to use.

Payout is fast but can be faster last one took me close to 50 hours to receive it.

Overall I think OFP is a good company",

"What I love the most about OFP is that it is Instant Funding this takes away all the stress of trying to pass a challenge. The option to choose when I can get payouts is a big plus and the consistency rule is something I love as it allows me to have a strategic management plan is place without over trading. Overall I will highly recommend OFP support is top notch and trading conditions great news trading, swing etc....üòä",

If I were to rely on an instant account to trade, I would definitely choose OFP. They are fantastic!",

"Best prop firm trade instant account real money don‚Äôt play here fast payout no deny no hidden rules no evaluation just trade your way",

"OFP would have been every traders dream prop firm but trust me traders, this firm is out to milk you at all cost. I purchased their 200k challenge while it was on a so called promo using INSTANT200K. For this promo, I was to pay $499.50 being 40% of the total sum. But surprisingly, I got a debit alert of $832.50. I reached out to the customer care and explained with screenshots to show the coupon stated VALID when i used it but i was frantically turned down. This goes to show OFP is SOLELY INTRESTED IN THE MONEY TRADERS PAY FOR CHALLENGE. I will continue to sing of this Fraud and convince as many traders as possible to STAY OFF this scam called OFP!",

"They provide quick funding which is really good to experienced traders who don't really need to pass a challenge before funding..",

"I just started gathering info on the company and what they have to offer. Honestly they seem straightforward and reliable as far as I can tell.",

"This company is really strange. many complex problems. When a problem occurs, send an email to support and they will reply but no solution will be given. It will not be resolved until reported on Trustpilot. Now that my account 1003373 was sent a payment confirmation email, the account is locked. Because of reporting a violation, 28 days of no transaction. While on April 29, 2024, support sent me an email advising me not to transact while waiting for payment confirmation.",

"Overall evrything is good but support services are slow",

"Greetings,

If you're considering purchasing a prop account with OFP Funding, my sincere advice is to stay as far away as possible.

After years of trading in Forex and working with various prop firms, I have yet to encounter a company that engages in such manipulative and deceptive practices. People pay in good faith, put in their best effort to complete the evaluation phase, and hope to earn a steady monthly return.

The issue isn‚Äôt with their rules. The rules are clearly stated and are meant to be followed. If you make a mistake‚Äîperhaps a minor one‚Äîthey‚Äôll give a warning, allowing you to correct it going forward. However, once you reach a funded account, adhere to all the rules, and finally submit a withdrawal request, OFP Funding begins its disingenuous tactics. They start fabricating baseless allegations, such as claiming that someone else was trading on the account or that someone external (like a signal provider) was contacting their chat support. They even went as far as to falsify chat conversations between OFP and this supposed third-party to accuse me of copying signals.

Even when I provided proof that all trading was conducted from a single, consistent IP address‚Äîmy own home IP‚Äîthey dismissed this evidence outright.

Stay far away from OFP Funding. If you are an EU resident, remember that you have agencies to report such fraud to relevant authorities. Do not hesitate to take action‚Äîafter all, it‚Äôs your money at stake.",

"OFP is a HUGE SCAM!!!! Let me explain‚Ä¶ I have a 100k account. I traded that account for 2 months to meet the consistency rule and made almost 12k in profits. At first they added a bunch of false violations and I received a Breach email and I looked on the dashboard and my account was violated so I just forgot about it and went on with my life. Then I received an email on my original payout day and the email said they require a video of trading strategy and how I acquired that strategy and suddenly my account was active again. Now, they don‚Äôt have ANYTHING about this ‚Äúrequired video‚Äù in the rules on the FAQ so you don‚Äôt know this exist until it‚Äôs payout day. Now with that said I don‚Äôt make videos, I‚Äôm not a video person. I have a bad stutter and I certainly am not able to do a video explaining everything. I have no experience or desire to be on camera. If I had known about this I won‚Äôt not have wasted my money buying an account. To me that‚Äôs called a hidden rule and it‚Äôs designed to use to deny payouts. That qualifies OFP as a complete scam!! I don‚Äôt recommend for anyone to use them because who know what other scam rules they will come up with. I have spoke to support several times about this issue and if I don‚Äôt make the video I don‚Äôt get my payout so that‚Äôs it for me with OFP. TOTAL SCAM",

"Customer support are great and helpful fast replying any time and any day... i am very happy with all of ther rules and transparency till now...I highly ecommend trying OFT Prop firm",

"Definitely a scam, I have wasted a lot of money. Passed my account many times but every time they come up with lame excuse to fail on the day of payout. Please beware unless you just opening the account for fun and money don‚Äôt matter to you.i have focused solely on Bulledge since they are consistent with payout,.",

"As a begining trader I was with limited funds and little knowledge until I found OFP Funding. After struggling for some time on my own I found OFP Funding's community and support a breath of fresh air. I now have all the tools and support to become a successful trader. Thank you OFP Funding",

"Fondi senza challenger,anche se preferirei non avere penalit√† durante le news a grosso impatto",

"It's really been a very terrible episode with these people, I have tried everything in the book to get out of here but it seem they have a plan of their own, and that's to steal from me. I won't use them if I were you. If I hadn't known about, EIƒ±te EcheIon, I would be in a very dire financial condition now, they have been wonderful and consistent with payments.",

"One thing I just have to say, if you truly know how to trade, read the rules and being disciplined in the front of your charts you will find out that OFP is the best prop firm that you have faced in the industry. Who else gives you up to 80% profit share with 5%daily dd, 10% max dd in an instant funding model. Yeah, they are strict in their rules but they are not impossible to follow if you are a good trader. For me OFP is that kind of firm that we need that last forever. I just said that because I particularly love the idea of earn from day one and I don't like challenges.",

"So far so good. Bought an account, had some questions and the support was quick to reply. Only started trading yesterday. So far I don't know about payouts or anything. Only that support and the website seems to work fine. I'll update the review once I get to payout stage.",

"The company looks great. Good Discord community, good support team and they have competitive pricing. What I liked most is that they are transparent. They have their legal company data on their FAQ and they explain their rules clearly.",

"The firm has been great, so far as long as you follow their rules you sure to meet your inconsistency score and get paid",

"I have had multiple questions and the customer service with OFP is top notch so far. Other prop firms seem to be slow is the service department. I am glad I have found OFP. They have been really helpful in clarifying questions I have had always on the same day. I am looking forward to a payout with them.... I will update when I receive a payout. So far so good with OFP.",

"Awesome. OFP is the best Funded without any challenges or evaluation. I suggest everyone in the world try this firm. I will add more reviews if I success get payout. Good luck",

"I got timely clarifications from the support team, and I believe the responses I got would assist me to trade and have better business relationship with OFP.",

"Beware of OFP ‚Äì Fraud and Dishonest Practices!
My experience with OFP has been an absolute disappointment. After 21 days of waiting, I did not receive my withdrawal of ‚Ç¨25,200. Instead, they provided false reasons to deny the payout. The support team, especially someone named R A U . . ., has been extremely uncooperative and dishonest. It appears that only selected people are paid out small amounts. My messages were deleted to cover their tracks, and my account (No. 1003179) is being ignored.

My lawyer is now involved, and OFP should gather their fabricated evidence. I will continue to report this company as fraudsters and take legal action. Be warned!",

"Hello friends.
I posted two review on OFP. They asked me to contact the support to review my case. But very sorry to say that support agent has no answer of my questions. He is not reffering my case to related department. They have hidden rules and they violate my account without any reason. I have all the proofs and have detail study of all the rules. Their CEO only post promotion material on discord. He didn't even bother to reply of coustomer. Only they are trying to sale their accounts not giving any attention to coustomer complaints.",

"Best prop firm you can trust no evaluation fast payout and more the best to trust don‚Äôt waste your time on evaluation again",

"I love this firm because their program is better and their challenges rule also clear. I have great support from them as well. Great to be part of it",

"Simon was really nice and helped with all my questions nicely",

"Informations regarding rules and regulations trading are clear enough and their support team is responsive.this is the only prop firm that I know only offer instant funding and fees are quite reasonable",

"OFPFunding, is a reliable and trustworthy platform. Not only it works as advertised, but in the community blog there are a lot of valuable information in order to support during the trading journey",

"George understood the assignment and the help i needed and he gave me a very specific ans honest answer. Better than that i could not describe it on my own. Thank you very much for the help",

"This platform is a scam. They say we're using illegal strategies when we try to raise the payout, and they don't show it in their dashboard until after they've raised it. This has happened to three people I know.",

"Scams...
Pyramid scheme...
Avoid going for OFP, avoid it at all costs.
It surprises me that they are operating in the UK in a such way.
Basically you pay money for DEMO accounts that will never pay any profit split. Pyramid scheme.",

"Payed for a challenge and requested a refund. NO REFUNDS RECEIVED. THEY WILL NEVER PAYOUT. SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM STAY AWAY SCAM SCAM RUN",

"OFP is one of the cheapest Instant Funding Prop around after some research, I've gotten an account and I'm currently trading. Support is 24/7 and very responsive. I'll be giving give stars if withdrawal is seamless",

"This prop firm pushes the finish line further with the more money you make. You can make profit with any other prop firm a lot quicker if you pay the same amount of money for an account. Inconsistency score is based on highest profit day rather than total balance on account. So if you have a record day of profits, the finish line is pushed further for you to meet the inconsistency score threshold. You're better off getting another prop firm that doesn‚Äôt have this in place.",

"Nothing more than they violate the account at any point and I show them that I did not break any rule, they can not clarify the reasons then they do not reply you any more
and I show them the graph of my account they manipulate the rules and also they have this hidden rule about max value which is crazy rule in my point of view",

"Ofp instant funding program is definitely the number one leading prop firm in the industry
They are unique in their ways and they offer the best platform for trading the financial market
Purchase an account today and you get funded instantly without thinking to pass any challenge phase
Also they have a consistency rules that guides you and make you keep check of your trading journal, some people thinks otherwise about this rules but sincerely this consistency rules will make you trade properly and have a realistic profit target other than over trading and risking your trading account

Also ofp customers service is TOP NOTCH, they reply and give you assistance right on time, TO ME THIS IS THE BEST PART OF THE COMPANY, transparent and reliable

ABOVE ALL O.F.P IS THE BEST PLATFORM TO JOIN NOW IF YOU ARE STILL STRUGGLING WITH CHALLENGES AND PHASE PROP FIRM

SKIPP!!!! ALL CHALLENGES TODAY, GET FUNDED INSTANTLY AND SPLIT PROFIT IMMEDIATELY!!!",

"OFP Funding has established itself as a notable instant funding prop firm with several distinctive features and some limitations. Here's a comprehensive review:
Key Strengths
Instant Funding Model
The firm offers immediate access to trading capital without requiring challenges or evaluations, with account sizes ranging from $5,000 to $200,000. This unique approach sets it apart from many competitors in the market.
Profit Structure
OFP offers competitive profit splits up to 80%, which has significantly improved their market position. Payouts are processed after just four days, making it an attractive option for active traders.
Trading Conditions
- No profit targets required
- Multiple currency options (USD, EUR, GBP)
- 1:100 leverage
- Various account sizes available
Consistency Rules
The consistency scoring system is well-structured:
- Calculated as the total profit of best day divided by total PnL
- Must remain below the maximum inconsistency score
- Helps maintain disciplined trading
- Does not result in immediate account closure if exceeded
Areas for Improvement
Platform Limitations
The firm does not allow Expert Advisors (EAs) or copy trading, which may be restrictive for automated traders.
Recent Concerns
Some traders have reported:
- Payout delays
- Account termination issues
- Slow response times from support[5]
Overall Rating: 4/5
OFP deserves a 4-star rating primarily due to its user-friendly platform, innovative instant funding model, and competitive profit splits[1]. While there are some concerns regarding support and certain restrictions, the overall package remains attractive for manual traders seeking immediate funding opportunities",

"OFT FUNDING is the best propfirm among others, you can set your draw down, the payment period and profit sharing.
The best thing is prices are very low and you're getting live account, there's nothing like one or two phase(s) challenge",

"It is geat not to do a challenge first and I found the app great to use and rules are easy to follow. Just make sure about no EA , hedging and consistenty rule.",

"A good prop firm in the industry who was been trying their best to give people the best trading experience as their are transparent one should definitely give them a try",

"They are extremely quick to remove bad reviews and Trustpilot helps them to do it. In a fair world where people didn‚Äôt get away with such obvious scam, OFP would have no stars. The reason they have 4 rating is because they remove the bad ratings. OFP is easily the worst thing in trading. It is pathetic they even exist. Scumbags.",

"So far so good OFP are doing great. Very clear rules. Fast payout system",

"The service is horrible, I had an account was trading well had profit then I kept having my lots changed I told them to check on it then I was suspended now I'm locked out of even my dashboard worst firm ever",

"I am deeply disappointed with the way my case has been handled by the support team. Despite following all the rules and guidelines, my payout of ‚Ç¨25,200 was denied with vague accusations of rule violations. To date, no concrete evidence has been provided to justify this decision.

The lack of transparency and the unwillingness to address my concerns properly only adds to the frustration. It feels like my case is not being taken seriously, and I have been left with no other option than to consider legal action if this issue is not resolved.

I hope the company takes this review seriously and finally pays out the funds that I am rightfully owed.",

"Good support and challenging prices,i see them going higher in competing other prop firms if they keep their momentum",

"Good firm to work with, you just have to understand the rules and follow them efficiently, you won't have stories.",

"Ofp gives low spread which is really good and has multiple trading platforms to choose from",

"There is no competition. You compete with yourself. Reliable in paying",

"I followed all their rules without breaching any but they denied my payout claiming that I don't have a clear and consistent strategy. There were no metrics on what is the minimum requirement for number of pips or hold time.
They then went ahead and reset the account wrongly which led to a breach that should not have existed. (You can't breach a max drawdown of 10% when you only lost 3%)
From your response OFP you didn't even bother to read the review.
The max daily loss on the account is 5% not 3%.",

"I just want to you traders to be safe. As of the 3/10/2024 FCA has listed ofp funding as unauthorised. Most reviews you‚Äôre seeing are from people who are just happy to have an account on time without evaluation but once they request a payout then it‚Äôs a different story if the payout is huge. OFP funding can manipulate your trades and their dashboard. Also ofp are not on companies house. I read another review from someone saying they were going to report them to FCA so it must of worked. I will be reporting them as well from how they manipulated my trades. Anyone in the UK who has been lied to by them follow me in reporting these thieves.",

"The firm makes up excuses to not pay you. they want to send them a video of your strategy if they don't like it they say your "gambling" despite having a high win rate and being consistent. others using the firm in the discord are getting payouts delayed or denied. STAY AWAY DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. Once you reach the consistency rule they wait till last minute to claim you broke a rule!!!!!!",

"Ya esta empresa esta en la mira porque NO PAGAN, ponen muchas trabas despues de ganar dinero, ellos alegan juegos de azar porque ven operaciones ganadoras en poco tiempo en minutos, el buen trader gana en segundos, minutos, horas o semanas, son estilos y estos desgraciados me robaron $8000",

"Definitely a scam, I have wasted a lot of money. Passed my account many times but every time they come up with lame excuse to fail on the day of payout. Please beware unless you just opening the account for fun and money don‚Äôt matter yo you. If u want I can show u my accounts.",

"There are more successful propeller companies elsewhere...

I earned ¬£300 in 15 days. I had to get the pound back whenever I wanted (¬£240).

(on demand) I talked to customer services to avoid any mistakes, they said you can open it 3.5 times!) (I opened it 3 times)

But the last transaction will be profitable.
Although it will not exceed 2 times... a rule within a rule, a rule within a rule... a completely malicious system

I'm sorry to say that it is not a safe company at all...

Labor theft.... Moreover, the prices are extremely expensive!

Don't give your money to this company in vain.

Do not trust this disgraceful company...

And when you follow your rights, you get bad results...

will prove it
I have photos. !
It was my mistake to trust.

They ended my 15-day winning streak by calling it a ridiculous rule violation...

If I had not asked for money, they would have continued to earn along with me (I would have won without knowing it and they would have earned more money in the end.
But my end will would be the same

My path is clear, I am successful...

I wish them success in defrauding people to you

I have photos to prove it. They ended their 15-day winning streak by calling it a ridiculous rule violation...",

"OFP has really improved. The opportunity giving to clients to configure their accounts is a very good future. I bought an account and immediately my payment was successful i was giving my login details which was so awesome.
Would give another review on the payout. Many thanks OFP for your exceptional services as you move to the moon/",

"Fast processing of my new account. It was sent to me right away. I dont have any problem with the trading platform Ctrader. Fast executions. Overall, very good experience. Plus, the price of this no challenge 25k buyone getone is a great offer for 399 for the 2 accounts! Thank you!",

"My payout date was October 14th. I followed all their rules and am eligible for a payout. I have received several payouts from OFP in the past so I know that they send an email, typically on payout day, asking how I want the payout sent to me. Then they send the money shortly after. The problem is it's now October 22nd and they have not sent me the payout email and they have not sent me the money. I have messaged their customer support team several times. All they tell me is to wait. I am very concerned that nothing is being done and OFP is not going to pay me. This is the second time they have delayed payout like this. Last time they eventually paid after about 1-2 weeks. My account number is 1000645. When I receive my payout I will update this review.

Update: OFP denied my payout. Their reason to deny the payout was because my risk to reward ratio is 4:1. They stated they believe that this shows poor risk management. Keep in mind OFP has already paid me 5 times in the past using this same strategy. They said this falls under their gambling restriction and stated I have to lower my risk to reward ratio in order for them to pay me. The problem is the gambling restriction does not mention anything about consistently using a high risk reward ratio with a high win rate across many trades in a pay period using the same lot size and risk. I offered to lower the overall risk and profit target so that I could use the same strategy with lower risk to the firm. They refused and still stated the risk reward is too high.
Buyer beware: they can subjectively interpret their own rules in order to deny payouts even after you have received a payout using the same strategy.",

The FCA have emailed and confirmed you are a scam (their exact words) those are FACTS. You pay a few but scam the majority! Your positive reviews are fake or from the tiny percentage that you choose to pay then you will shut their accounts too and give no evidence of your crazy claims. Every email of non payout is exactly the same from trader to trader that you‚Äôve scammed. THE FCA HAVE LITERALLY CALLED YOUR COMPANY A SCAM AND I HOPE YOU GET SHUT DOWN REAL SOON.

"Nun, ich bin hauptberuflicher Trader und kenne mich doch recht gut in dem Bereich aus. Die Firma - wie soll ich sagen, es gibt definitiv bessere - auch im INSTANT Bereich! Um es kurz und einfach zu sagen, selbst wenn man konsequent Handel, es wird wirklich IMMER ein Grund gefunden den Payout zu verz√∂gern, zu k√ºrzen oder komplett zu steichen. Los ging es mit einem Video zum Nachvollziehen der Strategie, wie ist mein Handelsstil und ist dieser auch f√ºr "die Firma" nachvollziehbar - tut mir leid, das geht gar nicht! Wenn man sich an ALLE REGELN h√§lt (die es wirklich in sich haben) sollte man nicht noch √ºber die Nachvollziehbarkeit eines Trades sprechen - und nebenbei, ist es auch relativ ob man "meinen Stil" nachvollziehen kann. Daf√ºr sind wir Trader um FREI zu handeln (mit Einschr√§nkung der Spielregeln)

Auch die Dokumentation sprich f√ºr die, die in Deutschland leben - Thema Rechnung usw - leider sind sie da nicht fortschrittlich.

Aber v√∂llig unabh√§ngig - das Ende vom Lied war - ohne NACHVOLLZIEHBAREN GRUND wurde dann der Acc gesperrt und geschlossen. Ich kann alles nachweisen, somit sind da hier keine Leeren Worte. Es handelt sich u.a. um eine Auszahlung im knapp 5stelligen Bereich.

Man investiert also zum einen f√ºr den ACC (eh klar) dann aber die Zeit und nach Wochen... oder l√§nger stellt man fest- tja,...au√üer Spesen nichts gewesen.

Toll fand ich damals den Charety Gedanken welchen die Firma verfolgt - leider w√ºrde ich niemanden empfehlen hier ein Acc zu er√∂ffnen.

In der letzten Email hie√ü es - sie sind dem Trader keine Rechenschaft schuldig wenn sie die Beziehung aufl√∂sung.

"Hello Everyone,

This is my second review of OFP. After posting my first review, OFP responded, asking me to contact their support team to review my case. I reached out, but no one addressed my core question: Why was my payment denied?

OFP has a dashboard that tracks rule violations, and my dashboard showed no violations. I‚Äôve spoken with multiple support agents ‚Äî Raudel, Yusirat, George, Blessing, and Lameck which was a waste of my time. They're not interested in resolving your issue. Raudel even told me in writing that they are not required to provide proof of my violations. I have documented evidence that I followed all of their rules, yet my payout was denied.

Based on my experience, this company is a SCAM. If you browse through Trustpilot reviews, you‚Äôll notice that almost all the 5-star reviews come from people who either: Never requested a payout, or received a small payout.
On the second day of trading with OFP, they asked me to write a review. Had I completed it then, I likely would have given them 5 stars, as everything seemed fine initially. However, things change when you try to withdraw profits. That‚Äôs when the company becomes unresponsive.

Most 1-star reviews if not all are from traders who made significant profits ‚Äî typically over $5K. These traders are suddenly accused of violating rules, such as:

Using signals, group trading or trading the same instruments as other traders. This is their made up excuse to refuse a payout.
OFP refuses to provide details on these alleged violations. They won‚Äôt disclose who these other traders are or show specific trades that supposedly broke their rules.

15% of all OFP Trustpilot reviews are 1-star, mostly from traders whose payouts were denied after making significant profits.

Save yourself the trouble ‚Äî avoid OFP and go with a legitimate company that values transparency and integrity.

Thank you for reading.",

"I was able to meet their inconsistency score of 14.82% in the recently concluded trading cycle (October) my account is 1003445. However, during the review of my account, they referenced a news violation that occurred in the previous trading cycle (September). When I inquired with Blessing, one of their support agents, he mentioned that all violations flagged in September should have been reset at the beginning of the October trading cycle. Therefore, I was surprised to see my payout denied for reasons related to the prior cycle.

In my previous experience here on TrustPilot, I was informed:

"If an account is flagged for 'news straddling,' even if the instrument appears indirectly related to the news, the payout for that cycle will be denied to ensure fair play and consistency. However, your account remains active, and you can continue trading to earn profits for your next payout cycle."

I adhered to this guidance and continued trading until the next payout cycle, yet my payout was still denied based on reasons from a previous cycle. This situation is not clearly addressed in their rules, and it seems that Blessing and the review team may have been searching for justification for the payout denial, as evidenced by their responses:

10:28 AM | Blessing from OFP: "Your account review was supposed to have occurred in the last cycle when the news trading was flagged, and the payout should have been denied then. Since it was skipped, the review in this cycle resulted in a denial and the score reset."
12:37 PM | Blessing from OFP: "It was reviewed, and you did not meet the score, regardless of the violation."
12:42 PM | Blessing from OFP: "I just confirmed with the review team, and that was the explanation I received from them. Accounts are only reviewed when the score is met."
These three reasons do not align to provide a coherent explanation for the payout denial. OFP continues to lose its integrity as a prop firm, particularly when such issues arise. It raises the question: why encourage traders to continue trading an account with violations if the outcome is a denial of payouts, irrespective of the trading cycle? They claim not to have hidden rules, yet this appears to be a covert method for denying payouts.",

"TAKE A LOOK AT ALL THE 5 STAR REVIEWS, THEY ARE ALL FROM NIGERIA. WHY IS THIS SO? USE YOUR HEAD. OFP FUNDING IS GOOD AT REPLYING TO LOW REVIEWS.

THEY ONLY PAY OUT 6 PEOPLE PER WEEK WITH LOW AMOUNTS SO THE PUBLIC THINKS IT'S ACTUALLY WORKS. WHICH IS REALLY SMART. DON'T LET THOSE SCAMMERS FOOL YOU WITH THOSE 5 STARS REVIEW.
THEY MADE ME TRADE 28 DAYS UNTIL THE DAY OF MY PAY OUT, THEN CLOSE MY 2 ACCOUNTS AND TOLD ME THAT I HAVE BEEN BANNED. THEY WOULD ALSO DELETE YOU FROM THEIR DISCORD GROUP. GOD KNOWS HOW MANY PEOPLE'S PROFIT THEY TOOK ALSO. I COULD WRITE ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT THEY DID TO MY 2 ACCOUNTS, BUT IT WOULD TAKE ALL DAY. THEY WOULD EVEN MANIPULATE THE ACCOUNT AND CHANGE THE FIGURES ON YOUR DASHBOARD TO MAKE SURE YOU VIOLATE THEIR TERMS TO SUSPEND YOUR ACCOUNT, THEY LITERALLY JUST DID THIS TO ME AND I DIDN'T DO ANY OF WHAT THEY CLAIMED.

"To be honest i find OFP FUNDING a honest and clear prof firm in the industry when we talk about rules and test prices",

"I have purchased one account of 200k ( worth almost 2k ) and after trading for 2 weeks, I have had 28k profit. When I requested my payout, I got an account analysis and I had my payment declined with the reason that "I was one side betting". When I asked the support team how many layers I am allowed to open, I was told "as many as I want". The reason why I bought an account that was was to be able to open how many layers I wanted whilst following their rules. All the time they come up with different unwritten rules such as "a trade has to be open more than a minute", or other traders were requested to present a video to explain their strategies.
I got pissed because of the denied payout so I blew the account. After 8 days, I got another email saying "During this review, we identified behaviors associated with prohibited activities such as group trading, trading signals sharing, account management, and device sharing. Specifically, this falls under our Group Trading policy, where one individual, device, or trading signal provider is involved in managing multiple OFP trading accounts." And they banned me. I was trading 8/9 hours per day, watching charts and doing analysis and they decided this in 2 minutes.

They claim they are doing the payouts... Yes, worth of few hundred bucks. The real money, they delay or find stupid excuses not to pay.

Don't believe me, check their discord group and you will see.

Yes, there are 1 or 2 guys good in customer support (admins), that's why they have so many good reviews, however, not for payouts.

"0k , this will probably be my last review since I am still waiting for the review of my account incorrectly rejected for my payout, I was told by support that I could scalp and was denied payment for scalping, coming in under the TVS , they changed the name , and with a success rate of 93.75% and trading carefully and professionally I was expecting to be paid, then like many other traders was refused, I noticed that they are still tell people that are looking to buy an account that you can scalp , I warn people, if you want to be paid , don‚Äôt scalp . This is what support is still saying tho ,
, ‚Äúwe advise to allow the trade run for at least 1 minute‚Äù that was direct advice from their support a week ago so don‚Äôt believe this advice.weeks later and still haven‚Äôt heard anything, to by support last week to wait ‚Ä¶ still waiting , for the record, my shortest trade was 6 minutes.

These are the profits that I made scalping that where rejected, I told them on discord that I‚Äôm happy to have my account made public so that they can see what is being rejected and people asked me why I wasn‚Äôt getting paid , I answered and was blocked from their discord, I have pretty much written off the money that im owed and im continually inundated with discount offers on accounts from them which is pretty funny . And to support if you answer this , I have already given my name , account number, email and phone number to you, multiple times , you seem interested when there is a negative review then absolute silence when out of public view. You need to be honest about your rules, tho support doesn‚Äôt seem to know them either. And you need to pay your traders .oh ‚Ä¶. And the last payment cycle I didn‚Äôt even get an email about the account as you are supposed to , seems to be falling apart and their dashboard still doesn‚Äôt work and no , I‚Äôm not sending yet another screenshot of it .
Should also say , the dashboard hasn‚Äôt had any violation warnings in regard to the rejection
Just noticed the warning about the regulatory authorities are looking at them now , not really a surprise with my experience",

"I haven‚Äôt reached To the the payout yet but to support team is extremely fast and very friendly shoutout for the SAAD!!",

"This is the worst firm every they will have long list of hidden rules firstly the mostly not possible for everyone to reach their consistency rule which 25%-12% depending on your payout account. If you will reach payout by any chance they will find n number of ways to deny your payout and suspend your account directly. And lastly if reach payout by luck and receive payout after couple of days you will receive mail that you are banned from OFP services because of group trading or multiple device use. I was having 2 accounts and suddenly they banned both the accounts. When I tried to customer support they said nothing can be done. No proof nothing. They have equity based daily drawdown, HFT rule which is ok but the minimum time for holding a trade is not defined, etc rules. I received below mail for ban when i informed people on discord channel they banned and deleted my message. There many other trader who got similar mail. This prop firm is completely fraud stay away please.

Dear Trader,
We hope this message finds you well. We are writing to inform you of the results of a recent audit of your account at Overview Funding Program (OFP). At OFP, we uphold strict standards in our audit processes, and as part of this, we have conducted a thorough review of your trade execution and account activity. During this review, we identified behaviors associated with prohibited activities such as group trading, trading signals sharing, account management, and device sharing. Specifically, this falls under our Group Trading policy, where one individual, device, or trading signal provider is involved in managing multiple OFP trading accounts. Such actions are strictly prohibited, as they suggest an intent to circumvent our rules and exploit the platform. This behavior violates OFP‚Äôs core principles of fairness and integrity. We are committed to ensuring that all traders operate with professionalism and adhere to sound risk management practices. As a result of our investigation, we regret to inform you that your account has been permanently terminated, and you are now banned from accessing OFP's services. We strongly encourage you to review our FAQs and Terms of Use, where further details regarding this violation are outlined. We understand that this may be a difficult message to receive. However, we trust that you will appreciate the importance of maintaining a transparent and ethical trading environment for all participants. If you have any further questions or require clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us. Thank you for your time, and we wish you all the best in your future trading endeavors.

Sincerely,
OFP Team Best wishes,

"What made my experience great is that I was contacted by Marcello regarding my payment when the payment day had reached, they did not wait for me to remind them about my payment or complain about payment , this was really a great experience, I wish all firms were this thorough.",

"My account got suspended with no warning.",

"They will fund you without passing any challenge, If you trade within the rules they will pay you. But the rules are very deep.",

"You can literally expect everything from OFP. New rules being implemented from one day on another and applied retro active, dashboard not being updated for many days, OFP team members giving contradictory information, unclear vague rules that they can arbitrary use against you whenever they want.

For example they are using in their discord "few minutes" to determine HFT, When I asked what is "few minutes" no one gave an answer. Or "trades should be executed in a manner consistent with responsible trading practices" to determine trade duration. Do you know what that exactly mean? Neither do I and do they.

They intentionally have vague rules so that they can use them to deny our payouts whenever it suits them in case the payment amount is too high for example. That's why you can not see any payout being posted in their discord by a trader (not by them as the payouts they are posting are fake!) for over 5000 USD. That's also the reason why they do all the reviews "manually"... You have a dashboard where the most important breaches are displayed but don't think because you haven't breached those rules that you will get your payout... I am in contact with over 5 traders who didn't received their payouts (one over 20k!) and we are considering taking legal action together against them. Please contact me if you also got a victim of their shade dark practices .Together we can be stronger and take action!

They claim to be transparent but I can surely say that almost no-one (including their own members) knows what exactly their rules are. There are so much rules that if I would write them all down, I have over 2 pages. Their website (Section Help - Account & trading- OFP rules) is showing the rules but they are incomplete and/or misleading:

Two examples from the rules on their website:

8. Are there limits on the lot sizes I can use?
A: No, OFP Funding does not have limits on lot size use.
-> This is totally untrue. They have a hidden "gambling rule" that said that you should stay within a lot range of 3,5 times higher or lower than your previous trade. Funny thing is that a trader with a 5k cannot open a BTC trade lower than 1 BTC as their platform don't allow it. In that case you are obliged to gamble and this is allowed.

12. Are there any restrictions on trade duration?
A: While there is no strict minimum or maximum trade duration, trades should be executed in a manner consistent with responsible trading practices.
-> This phrase is open for so much interpretation and thats exactly what they want. Unclear rules to deny your paout afterwards! For example you have trades less than 1 minute, you are risking that those trades will be counted as HFT...

I can give many more examples, if you want to know please contact me and I will give you a more detailled summary of all collected evidence over the last months.

My lawyer suggested to install screen recorders and taking screenshots from all the trades and dashboard so that you have proves of everything as they are also manipulating your dashboard. That's what I did and I will encourage others do do the same. I have collected a lot of prooves and I still have my account waiting to ask for my next payout. If they dare to deny my next payout, which I really hope they will do because I am more interested in stopping those scammers than being paid, I will take legal action with all the evidence collected.

OFP is the most shady company I have ever seen and ever dealt with! They have one problem: I have a lot of time and looking for a new hobby and my new hobby can be OFP :)

I am a good trader and I don't worry about not being paid with them but I dislike dishonest shady companies and I really feel sorry for all the traders falling for their practices. I will do EVERYTHING to stop those people!

Please also note that even the FCA is warning customers to stay away from OFP "You should avoid dealing with this firm and beware of scams." You can see this phrase on the FCA website, look it up and you will see it is stated on their website.

!! Most of the 5 star reviews here are posted from NON-OFP users who only are interested in winning a free account with them in exchange for posting a 5 star review... As they are constantly organizing a contest and so "buy" their 5 star trustpilot reviews to compensate for all the real 1 star reviews from traders experiences. You can check this on their discord channel!

"Review of OFP Prop Firm Funding.

I recently had the opportunity to experience the platform, Overall, my time with the platform has been a mix of challenges and valuable learning.

User Experience: The onboarding process was straightforward. The website is user-friendly, with clear instructions on how to get started. I appreciated the educational resources available, which helped me understand their funding model better. The demo account allowed me to practice and refine my strategies without financial risk.

Funding Process: OFP offers a variety of funding options, which cater to different trading styles. The evaluation process was rigorous but fair. I felt that it adequately assessed my trading skills without being overly restrictive. The profit-sharing structure is attractive, with reasonable thresholds for withdrawal, which kept me motivated.

Support: Customer support has been responsive and helpful. I had a few queries during the evaluation phase, and the team was quick to provide assistance, which I found reassuring.

Challenges: Like any prop firm, there were challenges. The evaluation requirements can be daunting, and I faced pressure to meet the targets within the specified timeframe. While this can be stressful, I also see it as an opportunity to improve my trading discipline.

Conclusion: In summary, OFP Prop Firm Funding has been a rewarding experience for me as a trader. While the evaluation process is challenging, the support and resources available make it worth it. If you‚Äôre serious about trading and looking for a prop firm that offers flexibility and growth opportunities, I would recommend giving OFP a try.

"I've almost given up hope about trading the forex market on a profitable bases due to my inability to raise the needed capital for average profitability. But OFP funding came through for me and they have revived my hope in the forex market based on this unique opportunity they avail everyone.
I went through their review on different social platforms and discovered that they have a very high credibility rating,and also they are about the only prop firm providing this kind of unique opportunity for traders to be profitable even with zero capital.

"I‚Äôve been trading with OFP Funding for a few months now, and overall, it‚Äôs been a positive experience. The instant funding model is a huge plus, as I didn‚Äôt have to go through evaluations or challenges, unlike many other prop firms. The payout structure is transparent, and the 40% monthly profit split is fair. I also like the flexibility they offer in terms of account sizes and trading platforms‚Äî which makes it easy to manage trades.

That said, there are some limitations, like the restrictions on using Expert Advisors (EAs) and certain strategies like hedging or arbitrage, which can be frustrating if you rely on them. Customer support has been decent, though not always prompt. Overall, OFP is a best option for experienced traders who want to avoid complex evaluations and just focus on trading.",

"I am ANDOW FREDRICK PIUS from NIGERIA.
OFP Funding raise my hope for Funding account for the fact that I will start trading without a Challenge from the very moment I subscribed.

"Vamos adelante con esta empresa, espero continuar por muchos a√±os con esta empresa, tener la consistencia no es f√°cil pero las reglas de la empresa te obligan a respetar tu plan",

"In it's way to become the best prop firm. I recommend++++",

"OFP Funding have come to set world %100 standard, required in :customer service relationship , fast and quickly response with accurate information needed .
In : transactional transparency like profit sharing after successfully trade they are %100 .
OFP Funding dashboard is secure and simple to access am speaking from experience not just from observation . Above all I would like to recommend OFP Funding to all the traders all over the world who wants to archive their dreams through financial trading this your gateway and reliable prop firm .",

"I want to share my experience with OFP funding after having worked with FTMO, InstantFundingio, TheFundedTrader and just passed Aphla Capital evaluation. Unfortunately, my experience has been extremely negative with OFPfunding.

Initially, I faced issues with the dashboard showing incorrect tvs and trades for two weeks. Although that was eventually resolved, I encountered a news straddling violation right after this was resolved. When I reached out, they provided a screenshot showing I took a trade at 14:00 CET, which was incorrect. I had taken the trade at 11:01 CET and took profit at 14:47 CET and after I sent them my screenshot, they said they would fix it.

However, the next morning, I found doubled trades and some trades that weren't mine on my dashboard. Initially, My most profitable day I made ¬£1,207, but it had inexplicably changed to over ¬£3,000 on their dashboard. I spoke with Blessing, who didn't initially review my screenshots, forcing me to repeat my concerns. Eventually, Blessing acknowledged the doubling of my trades. But as they worked on that issue, I logged back in to find I had violated hedge and martingale rules due to these discrepancies.

I informed Blessing, and he asked for my trade history, but I‚Äôve never encountered such issues with FTMO or Instant Funding. The manipulation of my trades made me uncomfortable; I refuse to work with a firm that can alter my trades. I shouldn‚Äôt have to spend hours fixing their errors, so I requested a refund due to their mistakes and the loss of trust.

Additionally, I was informed by George and Raudel that they don‚Äôt follow the Forex Factory calendar but rely on Investing.com, which is filled with high and mid-impact news on a daily basis. Do they even disclose on their website that they don‚Äôt use forex factory knowing 8/10 traders use forex factory and these are nothing but facts. They indicated that trading during high-impact news could result in a violation, even if it doesn‚Äôt directly affect my instruments. In my case, they almost claimed I traded XAU/USD during a high-impact German CPI, which was incorrect as their system misreported the trade timing.

Given these issues, I decided I no longer wanted to work with OFP, as my experience has been quite concerning. I was not in drawdown, I was in profits actually this morning while I was talking to blessing I‚Äôd have ¬£530. Blessing refused to issue a refund due to errors on their end, so I contacted my bank, which has since refunded me after I submitted all my chats with Blessing, George, and Raudel. I've never seen a reputable prop firm operate so inconsistently and manipulatively. Good luck to anyone who trades with them. I also was thinking last night since they are based in the uk let me take a drive to their office so I can show them my dashboard in person. The address that they have a an office to let anyone can buy that office as their registered address also I could not find ofp funding on companies house. Anyways I shall continue my trading journey without these lot. Also I will be doing a TikTok reviewing them because I‚Äôve been recording my trading journey and even recorded my self while I was chatting to them last night and this morning I‚Äôm just editing the video now and putting everything including the chats with Blessing and them lot into the video.

Also when you write a review on here it warns you that OFP have strike some attention from some financial bodies. I will also be reporting them to FCA",

"After trying out several other prop firms I settled with OFP
I'm still within my first month but so far so good. Currently trying to get my inconsistency score to below 25% which i really enjoy the challenge of to get my first payout.

It's a very good prop firm and they are very transparent with everything so far.

Would definitely recommend OFP to anyone looking to trade, new or experienced traders alike",

"Well firstly their support system is fast, their accounts are affordable moreover their trading rules are clearly stated, no hidden rules",

"MUSTY ICT WIZARD

My experience with OFP is great,
I love the model of the funded account that offers as lowest price as $18.25. The dashboard is very simple to access all needed information and i love it
they have a very good Customer service that will resolve your problem as soon as possible, they are the only prop firm that have the lowest prices when purchasing an instant funding account. You can get instant funded account at $18.25 which is very interesting.
OFP is here to stay and its here to help traders to become successful.

Much love OFP funding and i believe you will make it to the top soon",

"I've used OFP account for like 3 months to be sincere my trading experience has been good since I worked with them.

"Best prop firm

"Instant funding and the lowest fees for package make OFP on top of all funding platforms.
OFP approach to the Customer is very quick positive and to the point.
Some issue is there in kyc verification section as I face blur camera issue when uploading my kyc.",

"I love their simple trading rules; they want us to succeed in the market as traders and make consistent profits, not gamble like other companies. The instant funding is a great feature that helps us avoid the stress of passing each step or taking unrealistic trades that we wouldn‚Äôt even take with our own money, allowing us to make profits as usual with our trading setup.",

"I've tried a few firms -but OFP stand out. Reliable trustworthy and do what they say. After speaking to a representative recently -all my questions answered and followed up with e-mail.
Am really pleased with my decision.",

"Reliable prop firm easy to communicate financial freedom at your phase' easy rules law account fees and so much I really appreciate you guys ofp funding you're the best in the industry:",

There customer service is amazing it takes less than 10 minutes for all your questions to be answered. They are very kind.",

"I recommend OFP funding for traders who do not have so much capital because OFP is just like trading a personal account considering the fact that you start trading actively from the first day and not having to go through the traditional challenge phases.",

"Serious company, payments and assistance are good.
Pretty strict rules in respect to other prop, but this is not a cons...because every REAL trader already follow those rules: they simply not allow gambling as other props do.",

"Pretty Good",

"Estoy muy contenta con esta Prop Firms cumple todo lo que dice",

"Sangat recommended banget bagi trader pro yg mau trading full time",

"The prop firm has a transparency rules and guideline that benefit both parties in the business. Their customer service and pay out are top notch. Their trading dashboard is cool. The firm is fast in execution of trade in their trading platform.",

"So far haven‚Äôt paid yet so will not give my 100% review as the last time they didn‚Äôt pay saying I was too quick to sell. They want us to wait and lose like they don‚Äôt know the Market. üôÑ So far just wasting my hard earned money in hope of getting some back to run the house.",

"El poder comprar una cuenta sin tener que pasar un challenge es de agradecer, no obstante no todo es tan sencillo como parece ya que debes cumplir con lo que antes llamaban TVS (ahora "inconsistencia"), que es algo bastante complicado se lograr ya que dependiendo del % que tengas que cumplir (15% en mi caso) significaria tener un win rate muy elevado, impidiendo con esto muchas estrategias de trading. En mi opinion, es un valor que no ayuda al trader, sino mas bien es una forma de que los clientes no realicen retiros debido a la dificultad de conseguir dicho valor (para mi es mas sencillo pasar un challenge con la estrategia que mas se adapte a uno y evitar este tipo de cuentas en la cual es muy complicado cumplir con esta regla)",

"The company workers they respond in time when you need help",

"I love that they have clear cut rules that are easy to understand and the profit split percentage is fair.
Quick payouts and I just love how there's no challenges I bought my account and started making profits.

If you're looking for larger capital to trade with without evaluations OPF is the one",

The profit splits are generous and customized to fit your needs, and payouts are processed quickly and smoothly.

For anyone seeking a prop firm with fair conditions and immediate access to live capital, OFP Funding stands out as a top choice. Highly recommended!",

"I have purchased two accounts with OFP and about buying the third. The instant funding is a factor for me since I don't have to stressed myself for months trying to pass challenges.
OFP has one of the most affordable accounts in the market with innovative customisation that uses 3 parameters (mode of payment, drawdown, and size of account). The cheapest starting at $18.25.
And they also use powerful trading platforms like cTrader, Tradelocker and MatchTrader. I consider this to be a game-changer.
Their customer service agents are very responsive and quick in resolving any doubts.
The only challenge is their consistent rule you have to meet in order to receive payout. This might seem a bit complicated for new traders. But overall, I'll recommend OFP to others.",

"Their flexibility in choosing your funding account, the great prices and the helpful customer service make me like this experience",

"I've given my previous feedback with this scam prop firm and this will be the last. Stay away from this scampany. They manipulate your trades. I've taken a screenshot of all my performances in match trader and dashboard because I am tracking my everybody profit and TVS. I was in 1 week profit already and starting my 2nd week to hit my TVS and about to withdraw the profit. I have 1 missing trade on my trading history on that day that I was looking for and true enough that they will do something fishy. They replaced my missing profit trade by a .20 lot trade and I received an email that I used a martingale strategy in which I don't change my .10 lot trade. All my trades are in .10 lot only and I am only trading XAU-USD pair. Don't be enticed with their promos as you will only waste your money. Be Aware my fellow Traders!!!",

"I am writing from the position of a "loser" after losing two accounts one after the other. However, this does not prevent me from telling the truth, because the losses were the result of my fault.

ofp's TVS rule helped to make a target per day and never exceed it
taught me how important is consistent small efforts is better than big intermittent effort",

"Guys be very careful with this company, the rules are very tight and they will only let you know if you have broken one one the account is terminated rather than beforehand so you can adapt. They pulled me for hedging, which I dont do with the same pair as lots of firms dont like it. These guys class hedging in a more extreme way, eg XAUUSD Buy and EURUSD sell. It's a very harsh rule and I see no manipulation or advantage to this. I would personally go for a prob firm that wont try to trip you up. They would even give me one chance to rectify FYI, it was buy a new account only.",

üò≥üò≥üò≥ nah this rules gotta go it‚Äôs so confusing

Customer rep; You cannot exceed total profit of 570.85 in one single day. It more like making $560 or less till you meet the total profit value. If you make above so your total profit will increase.",

"I‚Äôm having a good Experience with OFP. Have not made any withdrawals yet due to the high TVS but will definitely go for a higher payout. Will definitely recommend OFP with friends & family members",

"so they had this big promotion going, i think it was Black Friday...so i went big...and went home, afterwards...(if you can figure out what that means).
anyhow, this review is about OFP, not me.
they are trying to protect their capital under the rules guiding 'safe trading'...maybe, they should make it written in stone - so everyone knows...
i like to gamble. and that's a big problem. anyhow.
they need to make the system less subjective - leave that for the clients to self-implode.",

The company is doing the biggest favor to all forex trader around the world.",

"I believe OFP is one of the most reputable firms with the most transparent and straightforward terms and conditions. This helps traders understand the firm's rules and regulations clearly.
Secondly, one of my most stressful experiences in trading with other proprietary firms was the series of challenges a trader must pass through before their account can be funded. This experience was highly challenging for me. A firm like OFP, with a single payout system, would enable me to scale my account over a long period without facing such challenges.",

"Tienen toda la informaci√≥n simplificada y de f√°cil visualizaci√≥n,es muy pr√°ctica a la hora de que yo necesite revisar la informaci√≥n del historial,desarrollo y conclusi√≥n de mis operaciones ..",

"Better back with old ways, the rule is hardly follow",

"I like how OFP gives you the ability to choose how you would like to set the criteria of your challenge to where its affordable and still reasonable. Their customer support response time is pretty fast and reliable. They are very helpful and will assist you in various ways and take care of any issues that may arise. Would definitely recommend if you want the instant funding , remember its not a sprint but a marathon. Take your time and build with them and they‚Äôll take good care of you.",

"By helping people financially to start trading",

"I was attracted to OFP because of its unique funding model which I consider the best and most affordable in the industry. However there is still a room for improvement. I noticed a little setback in the dashboard. There seems to be no proper way to track individual trading on the dashboard.For example, I breached my last account the very first day I started trading the account but the the account admin seemed unaware, as I was allowed to continue trading until after more than a week, when the account was far, far in drawdown. Other Propfirms have facilities in place that detect breach immediately, and disable such trading account promptly. Even as I write this review, I still have access to the account, more than two weeks after it had been breached. I suggest that you people should see to this, so that OFP would be taken more seriously.
Again, I was expecting a real live account but was surprised that the account is a demo account in spite of being called instant funding. I think somebody should give explanation on this.
But in all, I consider OFP a very good Proprietary Firm capable of taking the business to a greater height.",

"First of all, OFP treats inquiries with dispatch, no matter how trivial it may appear. My inquiry about whether Metatrader 5 was one of their platforms was responded to within minutes and with dignity. Furthermore, I find their instant funded account offering to be most competitive in the industry. In my view, they also have the most comfortable rules. I find only the TVS rule to be a little worrisome. While it's true that they must take steps to protect the funds from being blown and are 100% justified in doing so, they should, however, keep in mind that profit payout is at the soul of this prop firm business, and should therefore look into making some adjustments on the rule, e.g. increasing the percentage metrics to between 30% and 35%, or stipulating the maximum percentage of account balance that can be risked on each trade. OFP is a listening Company and, based on past reviews I saw, I believe they will do something about this.",

"Instant funding account, lets you focus on goals. Easy to manage, easy to start an account, 24/7 support.

Love how the TVS challenges you to constant and disciplined trading.",

I would strongly suggest to everyone that OFP can be your reliable financial partner.",

"Instant funding is always the way to go...",

Platform is good, everything is mentioned clearly and what types of mistakes we are doing that are given with prove in the platform so we can understand about our fault. We need to trade with discipline not with gambling mentality.

overall this is the best platform for instant funding.",

"If you are just starting up trading with prop firms, there are two important things you need to help you succeed with speed. 1. Getting funded without any challenges with are designed by other prop firms to make you fail and, 2. the opportunity to cashout daily without restriction. To be honest, OFP has some strict rules, but those rules are in fact designed to make you even a better trade. Because, if you follow the rules, it will help you become a disciplined trade.",

"Thanks for allowing me the opportunity to join your funding program. The OFP website is very user friendly and informative and allowed me to decide quickly that I wanted to be part of this program once I reviewed the trading tools and guidelines.
Moreover, the help desk was patient and understanding with the questions I asked and did not rush me into making a decision to join. I would highly recommend this program to any trader willing to achieve financial independence and self growth.",

"OFP Funding is creating a great revolution in funding firms. They allow flexibility in choosing the drawdown limit, payout timings, and profit dividend in their instant funding options. Their customer support is also solid. I'm currently purchasing an account and giving them 4 stars for now. Once I'm satisfied with their payout system and other trading conditions, I'll upgrade it to 5 stars. I‚Äôll provide an update after some payouts.",

OFP has just one time payment for all the instant finding accounts which is also very great were we don't need to pay any monthly subscriptions. Their drawdown rules are simple. I am planning to join with them in near future.",

"The only prop that offers instant funding with 80% profit share and payout on demand",

"They seem interested in improving and reviewing customer experience",

"Their customer support is very fast and respondive which keeps them on top as a funded prop firm. It would be good if they give discpunt coupons frequently as this would give great chances to traders with less capital. Giveaways on accounts should be considered as well as competitions to empower traders.",

"i've purchased 5k instant funding account at just 46.24$. You can compare it with other prop firms, OFP Funding is way more cheaper then them and plus point you get instant real money to trade. Most i like about OFP Funding is that you can customize your order. i've been trading on 5k account for quite a time and the spreads are very low and you get filled at your desired price. I am giving them 4 stars because one thing i don't like is Trader Value Score because of TVS in my case i have to make around 700$ in order to redeem because my TVS is 15%. I use 1:2 risk to reward and risk 50$ per trade.
About there support team i have to tell you they are great i mean within 2 or 3 hours or sometimes instantly they will get back to you and solve your queries.
Overall OFP Funding is very good and genuine Prop Firm",

"What make my experience is that becos OFP is funded account with no challenges it's really helpful to small traders like us,God bless you with that",

"After first week with OFP and TradeLocker there appears to be a disconnect. OFP sends me the login credentials, TradeLocker then denies me a way to use the log in credentials.
I highly recommend finding a trading platform that you can build your own funds, and not believe the BS that you are actually given access to someone elses money. I highly recommend staying away from both platforms.",

"The profit share % is too low low that's why I'm giving it 2 star and I hope the payout doesn't be a problem with delays apart from that they are good company",

"Although the rules are a bit strict, I think it can actually serve as a stepping stone to build consistency in the long run. I‚Äôm looking forward to achieving great things with OFP!",

"The Instant Funding model with no time limits is a highly attractive feature of this prop firm, as it removes the psychological stress associated with traditional challenges. The pricing model is excellent, particularly for traders from developing countries.

"Ok these are my reviews
Likes!
1. I like the opportunity to be funded straight away.. honestly nothing beats that.
2.the dashboard is user friendly
3. I like the economic calendar
Dislike!
1. Over pricing. Personally I feel most traders may not be able to afford a reasonable account size considering the price tags.
2. I see no need for that currency stuff there.
3. No challenge rules on the dashboard to guide traders actions in order not to blow their accounts.

Further Improvements Suggestions

1. Consider offering tiered pricing or more flexible account size options to make the service more accessible to a wider range of traders.
2. Simplify the currency feature or remove it altogether to avoid confusion and streamline the user experience.
3. Introduce challenge rules or guidelines on the dashboard to educate traders on risk management and responsible trading practices. This could include:
- Risk/reward ratio tracking
- Stop-loss and take-profit alerts
- Account balance monitoring and alerts
- Trading strategy templates or resources
- Educational content and webinars on risk management and trading best practices
by checking these areas, the platform can become more user-friendly, affordable, and supportive of traders' success.
Thanks you.",

"OFP Funding has affordable pricing which surprised me due to its convenience. Furthermore, they also provide promotional offers consistently, further providing support to those traders who need them extra dollars.

The supportive team responds quickly and clearly to questions.
It is indeed great to see a platform with the lowest fee for registration.
However,I would have loved they included CTrader & Matchtrade to the trading platforms.",

They "came" up with this TVS rule.. And they dont even know it works. First the cust. servi. told me the TVS must be 25% for me to ask for a payout, then she said ohh.. it must be below than 25%... Total BS!

Thank God, I came across with the reviews and didnt let them scam me too..",

"very helpful and effective assistance.",

"Their customer support never give a clear answer , they keep going in circles to avoid answering serious questions",

Trovano il modo di non pagarti con qualche violazione assurda come martingala
Non si possono aprire due posizioni della stessa size nella stessa direzione
Assurdo

Solita prop di m‚Ä¶.",

"Just a easy complaine why everybody should avoid a scam company like OFP.

I had 2 account.
One account get payout rejected (24k) because of news straddling- im fine with that. Rule is rule and I make a violation.
But
My other account that had payout day get also violated and do you know why?
Read carefuly.

3 of 150 trades was closed after 5-10 min but I get my 15k profit rejected because of thoose 3 trades was in small profit.
We talk about 30-50$ in profit .

How can OFP reject that payout?

Their discord also goes crazy.
8of10 trader did not get their payout and for those who get payout is small payout like 500-1000 $ in profit.

Y√∂ur money your choise.
I made a misstake and buy account.
Dont make that misstake as me

As answer to ofp reply

My dashboard was clear and suddenly i get a gambling tagg on my payout day.
Ofp think im gambling when I took 2-3 trades with small profit

You guys want to discuss but block me for 7days because of i write how that can be possible.
I was not rude and I was very friendly when I write on discord to your support how this can be possible and why my payout get rejected And without any response or help you guys block me for 7 days and now wrote on trustpilot to take this discuss forward.
This is crazy

Second update.
When I was writing for my rights that blocking from discord its not okay they totally remove me from discord ü§£",

"I came across some platforms that offers Funded accounts, but OFP is the Best on every aspect! The platforms they are using, like cTrader! The price is unbeatable and also the Support team is very professional and helpful, the last time I reached to them!
If you need a Fully funded account, no wasting time on challenges, I Highly recommend OFP Funding!",

"Legit funding, easy and cheap. payouts are fast",

"I genuinely appreciate OPF's innovative rules, which set them apart. Trading conditions, spreads, executions is excellent too, No complains. However, my experience with their support team and technical aspects has been less impressive.

1. Inconsistent Support and Lack of Clear Guidelines:

Interacting with the support team on Discord has been frustrating due to inconsistent replies and differing understandings of the rules among team members. It seems they lack proper training to ensure unified responses.

2. Technical Issues and Erroneous Violations:

The technical aspects of OPF's platform have been plagued by glitches. I received a violation marked as 'Hedging' due to a technical error. Upon investigating my CTrader orders (DID568743 and DID567712), I found:
The opening times were different, despite OPF's software showing them as the same.
A third trade was incorrectly flagged, which the support team acknowledged as a technical error.
The two remaining trades were not resolved, despite clear discrepancies.
All three trades were assigned the same ticket and trade open time on OPF's dashboard, highlighting a significant technical flaw.

3. Unresolved Issues and Concerns
It's been over two weeks since I reported this issue, and the support team has yet to resolve it. The lack of a clear support ticket system and follow-up on unresolved queries is concerning.

Conclusion:
While I appreciate OPF's innovative approach, their support and technical aspects need improvement. I hope they address these issues to provide a seamless experience for their users.

I'm giving OPF a 3-star rating based on my current experience. However, I'm willing to revise it to 5 stars and beyond if they address the following areas:

> Resolve the technical issue that led to the incorrect 'Hedging' violation
> Unify the support team's understanding and responses to ensure consistency
> Maintain a smooth payout process without any bad surprises.

Once these improvements are made, I believe OPF has the potential to excel and provide an exceptional experience for its users. I'm looking forward to revising my review and acknowledging their efforts to address these areas.",

"I've seen their add on Instagram I was actually surprised about their funded accounts and their pricing . but I haven't bought any funded account from them maybe in future I'll buy.",

"Value for money! 1:100 leverage!The best prices in the industry for instant funding!",

"The customer support was quite friendly, the support experience I had on the discord platform was great, friendly, and very accommodating. They were even aware of the problem traders are facing before I even ask them about it.",

"Giving out direct finding to experienced traders without without setting them back to the level of new traders by of OFP is a laudable and commendable effort. This act instills more success confident in traders.",

"I have passed many challenges to get funded. But what is great with OFP is tgat there is no lengthy challenge so you can be earning from day one.

Aslong as you are a consistent trader OFP is the only funded account you will need.",

"OFP is good company. provide funded account with cheap prize but yeah it has TVS rule. but it is what it is. you got funded straight away brooo.",

"Support rapide et efficace. Choix de compte selon votre budget et vos capacit√©s.mais mon probl√®me c'est que ne suis pas habitu√© au ctrader .En plus tvs de 30% sera plus encourageant.",

"It's not possible to get payout with this prop firm, stupid TVS rule only allows to chase your tail !!!. You have to close your running profit positions because your daily target increase with minimum payout amount !!!
There is better prop firms for better price in the market !!!
AVOID !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

"Im writing this at very early stages as only had the platform for one working day. However so far everything has been very efficient and easy to navigate. The rules seem straight forward, the trade platform easy to navigate and the dashboard tells you everything you need to know.


I‚Äôve contacted customer service a few times as needed some clarification on a few points and they came back to me literally within 2 minutes and cleared everything up.

Will write another review further down the line, maybe when I try to withdraw some profits to see how efficient they are. However for now all great !",

"OFP is very useful platform to make money through trading",

"The great deals that the company offers were very excellent and the trading account that are sold are sold at a good price",

"Scammers ! The plateform didn't show your situation . And support team didn't understand the domain and they are very slow",

"Was a sceptical at first but surprisingly these guys are doing an amazing job for traders, payouts are on time, customer service response is quick. The rules are also easy to understand. The pricing is so reasonable compared to other prop firms.Give them a chance but pay attention to their TVS rule!!",

"1. The online support staff at OFP are incredibly helpful and supportive. Their positive attitude and patience allow for a sense of security in dealing with this firm.
2. OFP offers a variety of funding options to suit different needs and risk tolerances. It is easy to find a program that aligns with traders' goals.
3. I am impressed with the transparency of OFP's terms and conditions. The program rules are clearly outlined, and there were no hidden fees or unexpected charges.
4. The Max Trader Value Score helps to define a trader from a gambler. This is one of the best innovations in the prop firm space and OFP has been instrumental in its creation.
5. OFP's longevity in the prop firm industry is also an important thing to consider at a time when many prop firms are either closing shop or coming in without clearly defined strategies.
6. Even though OFP has been in the market for a long time, they continue to provide amazing discounts and giveaway prizes on a very regular basis.
7. If there is one thing I would personally like OFP to consider, that would be to create a program that has a maximum static drawdown without the daily drawdown option and a quick scaling system where the account can be doubled after achieving a profit target of 10%.

All in all, I would recommend OFP without any hesitation and hope they carry on being the flag bearers of the Instant Funding Prop Firm Industry.",

"Best prop firm without any challenges they give payputs on time and their support team is very supportive to their clients Probably the best prop firm in the world",

"So according to OFP rules, if the market suddenly goes against you, you must not close the trade so as not to appear as though you are gambling? Even if it takes your daily limit, you must allow it play out? Strange rules.

OFP responses keeps emphasizing fairness to all traders. How does my trading strategy negatively impact others traders? I don't understand this system. Can you please clarify?",

"OFP Funding support team so far so good is okay and the other rules are on point too . What I don't like about the prop firm are it Trader value Score rules . I think it will be better if they can say, for example on the 5k account "Once you reach $100 - $ 1000 on your on demand pay model you can be able make a payout anytime you want". In that way we would be able to trade and withdraw freely.",

"Una buena y r√°pida respuesta a mi problem",

"OFP is the best",

"Open to criticism and views/requests of customers. Recently, OFP removed the gambling rule on traders request. I liked this.
Customer support is very good and quick in resolving issues.",

"for me it's good there's no complaints from me",

"The service of OFP is very good. Fast answers, friendly communication and helpfull. Gives all informations, which are needed.",

"The company is great, their support is helpful and fast, and they do not deny payouts.",

"Great Instant Funding prop firm. I took advantage of a sizable discount on a ¬£200k account and am pleased to have seen management and support explain to their clients the impact of some rules that they have in place. I am pleased that management listens, clarifies or updates rules e.g. with regard to gambling behavior where suitable. If you do your due diligence and have patience with your results you can see that with a clear consistent strategy that the present rules are reasonable and you will receive a payout when in profit and the criteria are met. I haven't received a payout yet but am confident I will in future.",

"The company has transparency in dealing with customers. It actually happened to me before that one of the specialists impersonated the name of the company manager and contacted me. I informed the company and they took the necessary action against this fraudster. The company",

They late some months but they pay.",

"Although I have been trading positively in the heavily advertised 200K account for several weeks, I received a message today (only after explicitly asking for it!) that my account has been suspended because I allegedly used hedging. So here, every opportunity is deliberately used to avoid payouts and, above all, to conceal the fact that one has allegedly not complied with any rules. So people, keep your hands off such companies and stick to the big ones that can keep their promises and not just collect your money!",

"I honestly have no experience with OFP but I am sure they are fabulous!!",

"SCAM SCAM SCAM
Do not falll into the trap the rules are hard for a start. So set up to fail, the support staff or different names every few hours they all tell you different things and oftern there advice leads you to fail then the back track and say its tuff you should know your account and our rules. You ask if you are doing everything to stay with there rules so you can get a payout and all they say is they cannot review the account, its only done on the review day and will not look at it early. If a prop firm will not do all that and check your on the right lines its definitelya scam. I've had chats removed deleted ect that say I can do something and then it's cause it to fail so they deleted the chat so they don't have to take responsibility. Yeah they will come on here now and say my account branched yeah I went 7usd over the 3k daily limit but my dashboard was playing up today and wouldn't moved to tell me how much of lost on my daily so it breached by 7usd but when the dashboard wasn't working and I kept telling them all day they did nothing. All these reviews that are positive are probably fake and bought so be careful guys! There's a hell of a lot more they will come on and say I breached yeah I did but they will never payout they like to say it wasn't real strategies and it was gambling so not paying out. It sounds good but like the say if it sounds like free cheese its probably a mouse trap.


In response to your response what a load of rubbish about the dashboards updating I kept telling support its not updated or moving my daily loss just said I still had 3k when I knew I wouldn't because I close some trades early however the dashboard was updating apart from that section the section which is most important so trades can see I also have evidence of this with time frames your pretty much say the same response to peoples review and say all your stuff updates regular however it didn't that day. If you are not a scam company why do you hide behind the keyboard and not answer a phone!!


Also everyone who has had a bad experience with this company can you make sure you write a review if you haven't to warn others from these scammers so no one fall into the cheese trap!!

I've heard FTMO are a good prop firm to use. üëç",

"Starting with how long OFP have been shows that they are here to stay. Then giving funded accounts is so interesting with the options of withdrawal percentages making the fee which is really a big deals for use in Nigeria . now i can get funded with as low as 18 dollars.",

"las reglas son claras desde el principio, tu eliges las reglas con las que quieres hacer tu cuenta. y en la plataforma te dice que te hace falta para retirar.",

"To be sincere, I don't like the TVS thing. It limits the way I trade and how much profit I make. I was on my way to payout only for a bad trade to take my TVS back to 100% and I eventually lost the account. I'd suggest that the TVS should be raised to 50% for all types of accounts.",

"AVOID ITS SCAM

I got reply that I violated 2 mins rule there is no such rule on Trading rules
I have received email that my account is violoated On the website rules says if you violate this more than 3 times then you account is suspended . So why my account is suspended and I have been denied the payout 2 times now . I have earned more thn 8% in profit for my 25K account

Martingale+hedging (0/3): Martingale involves initiating a larger position in either direction to the original one after experiencing a loss or while the initial position remains open. Hedging, which involves opening opposing positions on the same asset, undermines fair trading and disrupts the integrity of our platform.
Failure to adhere to this rule 3 times will result in the closure of your account.

Even last time I din't use any prohibited strategy still you denied me payout saying you dint like my way of trading . This is blatant scam and I am being denied payout even after putting hard work for a month",

"I bought an account and traded at OFP. Everything is fine. Customer service is very convenient. Dashboard is easy to use. I haven't reached the payout stage yet, so I won't talk about that part. What I like about OFP is that you can get a funded account without having to pass the challenge. And the price is not too high, so it is convenient. TVS is a bit annoying, but this makes me control my greed. All in all, I think OFP is a prop firm that traders should choose.",

"The prop firm has 2 trading platforms which match and C trader i chose match trader it was fast and accurate in excutions the support time were help ful and polit i enjoyed it for real",

"From the friendly prices set to create an inclusive environment to all traders to the well laid out Web page display that makes easy navigating all the search users may have. The customer care response is good enough. And the trading platforms in use are good (Love to see Mt5 added). Trading rules and prohibitions are fair and protective especially for new traders although some trades may argue this. The one area i cant speak on is a pay-out cause i haven't had one yet. However in all other parts I've seen so far. I give credit to this prop. Might appear new but does feel worth it.",

"Even though you are not expirence, or you are beginners traders, OFP is what will make you successful because they have no challenge that waste your time and blown your money.

"For the trader who tried a lot in other fund but failed because stupid rule, the OFP fund give you a chance to manage as it your money from the beginning. It give you the possibilities to take the risk as beginning and owner business of yourselves.",

"A trustworthy funding firm. I only had good experience till now with them. Customer service is quick, and they actually help resolve your issue or answer any questions you could have. Highly recommend",

"Prop firm with hidden rules.

They litterally have hidden rules so they can decline your payouts. on their discord everyday there is a innocent hard working trader losing their hard earned time with this prop firm.
There is a hidden rule that is not stated anywhere on the platform. Not on their official site or rules, not on their social media, not on their discord. but the rule still applies. For instance I have great entry points on my trades. So i leave a trade in less than 40 - 50 seconds. If you close a trade under a minute even if its one trade and its not in profit then you will automatically be disqualified from payouts and they wont let you know that even if you ask until the day of your payouts. meaning they will willingly continue wasting your time.

This trading strategy is repplicable in the real market and its just sniper entries. Despite some of the positive reviews here. if you really do your deep research into this prop firm you will see they're shady and scammy.

I did talk to ALL the support staff about this issue and no one had a clear answer, they're well aware of this hidden rule and refuse to own up to it. They give no excuse",

"Response was quick and very clear and well explained",

"I wanna say that the support team response is quite recommended,also you should also work on timely response of about two minutes, thanks for sending as the updates you make on the rules, keep it up OFP.",

"If you are looking for a prop firm that gives you a great chance of reaching payouts I would strongly recommend OFP. I am still positively shocked about their account model which is way better than those of their competitors, in my opinion. I am pretty sure ofp is going to be the new star in the prop firm universe.
Pretty fast pay out. Stunning support and c'trader as a platform. Superb.
In the past they had issues with their dashboard which was pretty slow. They kept working on it and have been improving it since.",

"All of a sudden, OFP got better with their model and pricing offers.
Really amazing.
The dashboard looks way better and sleek too",

"Christy50: My first experience was not bad even though I violated the trading rule.But they have been very honest and transparent and their support are very active and professional.They present practical examples for rules that may be difficult to understand.As little as $18 you can buy a funded account.There is nothing like evaluation.Another point is that they take feedbacks from their traders to review their rules which is remarkable.This makes it the best prop firm in the industry.I will stay with this firm.I will advice anyone who will not like to waste his time on evaluation account and want very active support team to try OFP.",

"Firstly for the fact that you can actually get an instant funded account with such little amount, I initially thought it was a scam but when I saw the different parameters and their amount, I believed it was legit cus the rules and settings are really helpful for both the traders and the company, it disciplines you to stick to proper risk management and a lot more, options to suite what you can afford, I just love everything about their services, support and effort",

"This firm only cares about you paying money to them but when you are in profit and time for payout they come up with anything to not pay your money.
my experience in short: I had 50k account with them and traded till I was in profit and managed to gain 3,685$ when I requested my payout they said started with the first thing'' you are gambling'' although this called scalping then they stand back and said ''We have noticed that there was a drastic change in lotsize compared to your most used lotsize''
and the other thing was ''We also noticed news trading violation.'' and this was for news of new home sales on 22nd August which wasn't even high impact news. the funny thing the total amount for those allegedly prohibited trades was 210 $ and then they decided oh lets cut his profit 3,685$ because of that. I have read the people reviews here on trust pilot but didn't believe that you are ready to come up with anything not to pay till I saw with my own eyes.",

"My first month had some problems trading during the news. But I know now so got my first payout email on Friday. Fantastic",

"My experienced with OFP was amazing in regards to my concerns specially the payout that i have the support team handled it fast and smooth. Thank you OFP you made my life better. Its a great feeling making withdrawals from my trading account thru OFP. I just made a second purchased of a 100k account because i trust OFP so much that this company can deliver what they promise to every trader all around the globe.",

"The support team has helped me as I didn't understand the rules and prohibited strategies, they have given me detailed understanding of how OFP works, so far it has been good trading with OFP",

"OFP funded I see as legit firm even as the low fees yeah‚Ä¶ but going through their rules
Hmm. Kinda fishy to me.
Money is never the problem but we the ppl behind are the issues
Since they look legit to me after some reaches on them and the lowest fees they offer, so I will be giving them a try, cuz nothing know if nothing try as simple as that.
I drop 3star because I haven‚Äôt traded with them just came to know about them and still doing my check on them, but what I‚Äôve found so far about them are positive so that‚Äôs why am giving them a try, after then with positive process and no issues with them
Then I will be glad to come complete it to 5..
Cuz personal I like appreciating good people with good work.",

"helpful helped me completely in my situation",

"I've found OFP to be the best prop firm, especially providing capital without the need to pass 1,2 or even 3 challenges. The ability to tailor the type of account I want is a great feature that allows me to tailor to my risk appetite and reduce payout frequency to make it more affordable. I also like the TVS as it makes me think about the trade and the risk rather than just having a percentage I must avoid for failing the account. I will continue to use OFP going forward.",

"I'm very excited right now because the 25k account that i purchased with OFP was successful, and the support team is very fast, initially i was very skeptical about OFP but when I made the payment my account login credentials was sent to me within a few minutes, an at this point in time i just wanna say that OFP is the best prop firm with instants funding, in this case if you're a trader out there i recommend you to OFP. One love üíú",

Honestly, I am learning to to be disciplined with my trading. I understand the TVS isn't everyones cup of tea however, what I would say is this sort of stops you from over trading. It's makes you work for your trades and in the long run, be more profitable. I would highly recommend OFP to give it a shot. Once I make payout I will update here :)",

ich habe bei Ihnen einen Account erworben und erfolgreich getradet. Leider musste ich feststellen, dass mir der Zugang zu meinem Account ohne ersichtlichen Grund verweigert wurde. Ich kann nicht nachvollziehen, auf welcher Grundlage dies geschehen ist, da ich mich an alle Regeln gehalten habe.

Es scheint mir, dass hier ein Betrug vorliegt, da mir keinerlei Verst√∂√üe bekannt sind. Ich bitte daher dringend um eine Erkl√§rung und um ein Gespr√§ch, um die Situation zu kl√§ren. Sollte dies nicht zeitnah erfolgen, sehe ich mich gezwungen, rechtliche Schritte in der EU einzuleiten, um mein Geld zur√ºckzufordern.

Ich hoffe, dass es nicht soweit kommen muss, und freue mich auf eine rasche Kl√§rung.

"REVIEW OF OTF CUSTOMER SUPPORT BY (OCHIGBO ONYEBUCHI).

I had an excellent experience with OTF Funding, particularly with their customer support team. From the very beginning, their staff was responsive, professional, and incredibly knowledgeable. Any time I had questions or needed clarification, they were quick to provide detailed and clear explanations.

What impressed me the most was how personalized their service felt. They didn‚Äôt just treat me as another client; they genuinely took the time to understand my needs and concerns. Their team was patient, ensuring that I fully understood each step of the funding process, which made the entire experience stress-free.

Moreover, the response time was always prompt, whether through email or phone calls. They went above and beyond to make sure I had the best possible support, even after the funding process was complete. It‚Äôs rare to find such consistent, high-quality service these days.

I highly recommend OTF Funding, especially for those looking for a company that prioritizes excellent customer service. They truly make you feel valued and supported every step of the way.",

"Hope fully everything will go well, but satisfied with customer service, but your reply is kind of delayed, other that everything is well, But i have a pro with your Offers are just exagrated as the Pricing is not in discount money wise the 100k challenge is way over the Price of your compettors.",

"I purchased 5k account and made a profit of 138 dollars.2 days after I received a mail that I have violated the rules as I have used hedging strategy. I never knew it before purchasing the account and suddenly get to know it. I want to know whats is the issue with someone's trading strategy? Shall we trade with your strategy only ? This is terrible and fraud company. Should take action against them.",

"Bad and unfair treatment
I purchased a 10k account a done some trades and as we all know pice can reverse on you but I know that I won‚Äôt pass my daily limit so I open another position same as the original one, I end up have some profit but then they emailed me that I broke their rules and they suspended my account!
Guys in OFP don‚Äôt want you to get any money period they just want to sell account that‚Äôs so obvious and now when I see all the negative reviews I can make sure that‚Äôs the whole story just selling accounts to people and then they will find a reason to close your account.

That‚Äôs my account number 1003401 by the way.",

"Too many hard rules and the web site is so slow",

"I'm new to OFP and, before buying an account, I asked many questions both to online support (very quick to respond, I received answers within a minute) and to discord support. I convinced myself to buy and so far everything is perfect, payment went on time, credentials received immediately, very low SPRED and commissions too. I'm getting along very well with them. The secret is to organize yourself, respect their rules and everything will go smoothly. I reserve the right to update my review in just over 20 days as it will be the date of my first payment with them! üí™üèª

update of 09/27/2024. unfortunately it is not as it seems. it is true the prices are very competitive the assistance works you can customize your experience. all in all it is a good OFP opportunity but, during the review, they declared my gambling strategy. guys, in a month the positions were 100% profitable - my entries, if you see carefully, are executed at very specific times and maximum one/two per day. some days I did not even enter because the requirements of my strategy were not met. scalping, gentlemen, is a strategy in all respects if done using your head and I believe that my history speaks very clearly!! precise entries and, true, not very durable! but 100% profitable. perhaps this is what scares. however, I deliberately burned the account as I do not change my strategy found in 10 years of study. I simply change platform. I had the feeling of having to deal with somewhat "hidden" and not very clear rules. unfortunately!",

"Lo qu√© pasa es que he tratado de comunicarme con O FP porque no quieren aceptar el pago con tarjeta de cr√©dito y s√≥lo me siguen dando vueltas y vueltas y no me dicen el por qu√© no se quiere aceptar si en el en sitio sale que est√° en revisi√≥n, y ahora ellos me dicen que mejor les pague en criptomonedas, y yo le estoy diciendo a ellos que eso es algo ilegal, lo que est√°n promoviendo porque est√°n diciendo que puedes hacer un pago con tarjeta pero a la misma vez no te dejan pagar con tarjeta. Ahora me dice que le pague con criptomonedas y yo le estoy diciendo a ellos que me den la raz√≥n.

"**Review for OFP Funding**

(As for the payout review and details, I haven‚Äôt reached that stage yet, so I‚Äôll provide an update once I have more information.)

As a first-time user with OFP Funding, I‚Äôve been impressed with their service so far. I purchased a funded account and received my credentials instantly, which made the setup process smooth and efficient. The cTrader platform is robust and advanced, and although I‚Äôve only been using it for two days, it seems to be a great tool for trading.

Customer support has been notably fast and friendly, which is a big plus.

Overall, my initial experience has been positive, and I look forward to seeing how it progresses.",

"Well support from customer service. Next review after payout",

"OFP is simply the best, first of all getting a funded account without going through any challenge is my blowing. Their customer service is commendable, no delays in responding to emails and the web interface is simple and easy to navigate. You deserve my 5 star.",

"I would have given it a 5star, but my verification is rejected, they need to improve in their verification",

"Am used 10k Account last day
Breached account
Reson is hedging
Am not using hedged all positions are one direction
Am add positions layer buy layer that my Startergy
All trade placed like that after 10 days company toled it‚Äôs violated
Ofp firms is fake chelating
Worset firms
Please any traders don‚Äôt buy please
Hidden ruls running lots of",

"Your guidelines are not clear and your chat support was not able to give proper answer.
My question was that I got a strike of gambling in my account and I asked will i get my payout this time or it will be denied . Then your chat support team was not able to give a proper answer .
If I will not get payout this time then why would i trade more this month .
Kindly clear this that if some one got strike of gambling once , is their any chance to get the payout or not .",

"I am working with OFP it is almost 1 year done nice experience from world's no 1 instant funding model.",

"IN THIS ADVANCE ERA OF TRADING!! why are you not on MT4/MT5 WHICH IS THE BEST AND MOST USER FRIENDLY TRADING APP TO MILLIONS? I GUESS SOMETHING IS REALLY FISHY HERE.",

"I am not going to stop outing these companies with their awful tactics. This is one of the worst. Before I started I asked the guy what the main rules were that and what specifically would defy the rules He said if you do not martingale or keep opening trades that are less than a minute. I said well I generally don't snipe and the majority of my trades are a few minutes and mostly more.
I originally found this company as I was looking for an instant account and not one with a challenge attached to it. It makes it easier when you don't have to do a challenge first. The guy on live chat said that it was a real live account that I would be trading with a few rules to follow, which I expected. My aim was to try and just make 30 dollars per day which meant that I would not over trade and look after the account.
As soon as I opened the LIVE account I received an email asking for me to give them a rating on here. How can you rate a company when you have only just started with them? I'm certain it was done so they could get lots of positive reviews and look great for anybody reading, therefore tempting them to join
Going back to the rules I was told do not go from a small trade and next do one about a million times bigger. I wouldn't do that anyway. Who would want to blow their LIVE account and lose.
The other main rule was not to use martingale. Now I would imagine every trader or gambler knows what the Martingale system was. If not then it's placing a bet and if you lose you double the stakes and keep on doubling the stakes until you win. When you do finally win you collect all your previous losses back plus one unit so you end up ahead. That is Martingale and there is no other martingale system so any other style of betting cannot be called Martingale.
I was trading away and I looked up in the corner of the platform and it said demo account. I thought, hold on the guy I spoke to said it was a live account. I went back to the live chat and asked the same guy why did he tell me it was a live account. He said when you are able to make money on a platform it's called a live account. I said, of course it's not you only have 2 types and they are live account or demo account. He didn't reply, but I thought I do not trust this as any and all winnings would be coming out of their pockets. So I was under the presumption that whatever happens, they are not going to pay out and even before the opportunity came to withdraw anything and I was about 180 in profit, I had an email saying that I had breached the account and can no longer carry on unless I buy in again. Oh no no no I was not having that, so I wrote an email and they came back saying that I didn't follow the rules and I failed 3 trades for using martingale system. Now I told them that that was not possible as I never once finished a trade then doubled up until a trade won. I even sent them through an article that showed the Martingale system.
They came back and said to me, well that is not our Martingale system. I said to them, as I told you before there is only one martingale system, so if you have a rule that is different you cannot call it Martingale as it is not and you are deceiving people. They told me I should read their system they are calling martingale, while I replied I don't have to as I have know the system for about 40 years. My final message was in that case you need to change the name of the system you are talking about as I traded making sure Martingale was not used. I finished with, one of 2 things you can do and that is either refund me or take the account back to the beginning and I will start again once you explain what the rule was. I have had no reply since therefore very suspect company indeed. Even more weirder is I can still sign in and trade on the so called breached account days later. REALLY?

** Here is my update after receiving their response
I was eagerly waiting for their BS reply and I will state again for the 4 time, there are NO different kinds of Martingale system, it is either Martingale or it's not. You cannot have your own definition of it and when I'm told to not use it and I know what the system is why would I need to look it up?
If somebody told me that they were going to lay some concrete on my drive, should I be looking up concrete when I know what it is. With this company the probably lay down sand and say that is their meaning of concrete.
With the live and demo debate, what they should have said is you will be using a demo account with real funds and the part where they said all prop firms have to deal with demo accounts as that's all they can use. Not really correct when I was using 2 prop firms before directly on a live account and not demo and that was even doing a challenge.
Finally they say if I wanted to contact them to discuss more about the situation then do so. I have already contacted twice and they ignored both times. I don't know why they didn't read my review as I already said this in there",

"Good. Made money faster",

"Todo bien , r√°pido y seguro . Es hora de hacer trading .",

"In general, I‚Äôm pleased that they‚Äôve eliminated the previous rules that felt like scams‚Äîsuch as trade time limits and mandatory minimum trade numbers within a few days. I‚Äôm currently giving them another chance, and so far, everything seems to be going well. However, I do have a minor observation about their customer service: it appears that they might either lack familiarity with trading intricacies and rely on pre-set responses, or perhaps they‚Äôre a tad too lazy to thoroughly research and provide accurate answers. I‚Äôll circle back with a final update once I have more experience.",

"I will rate OFP a five star ‚≠ê firm. I have received my 3rd payout without any issue.
If we follow the rules, they pay.
Thanks OFP",

"They keep to time with responding to clients, and response is fast and well detailed.",

"My review got deleted by trustpilot because they thought I was "suspicious". Weird but anyways. This firm is the best, have the best rules and I really admire their support. I got my tvs lower than 16% and tomorrow I can request a payout, will do at midnight. I will update after the payout as I said in the previous review, again as I've said, this firm really has everything.

UPDATE

It's been more than two weeks and no payout. I got an review on my account and first they said I had took 15 positions at the same time with is not ok, then I explained that those positions is not buys, its partial closers of one position, and then they wanted to review my account again as they probably saw that I did nothing wrong. Now I wait day after day and im getting no answers but "You will be emailed in 48 hours". after that time I ask again and the same answer comes. If I get my payout I will update again and change the rating but at the moment I am scammed of A LOT of money.",

"Honestly it‚Äôs hard not giving this firm a 1 star review, rules breaks and breaches will be handed to your account for the slightest mistake. Even if you didn‚Äôt break a rule they still will find a way to breach your account right before payout. Don‚Äôt buy this firm DONT!!",

"So far the experience has been great. Support is brilliant, pricing is fair and spreads and commisions are inline with the rest of the prop space.

I will update this review once I recieve a payput, due on at the end of the week.",

"No need to pass any challenge, simple rules to make you a successful prop firm trader.
Customer support response is at the speed of light.
I lost my account and I attribute that to my personal mistakes.
I‚Äôll definitely get another account with them.

"Compr√© la cuenta de fondeo de 25k al 60%, el primer mes estuve operando y al momento de cobrar no pude por no cumplir con la regla del 25%, despu√©s por un problema personal dej√© de operar como un mes y medio, volv√≠ a operar con lotajes bajos para controlar mi gestion de riesgo y result√≥ que eso era una estrategia llamada martingala que no conoc√≠a y me pusieron una infracci√≥n, no me enter√© de esta infracci√≥n hasta hoy, no me notificaron ni nada.
Despu√©s tuve 3 infracciones m√°s por una estrategia de cobertura de la cual tampoco ten√≠a conocimiento y despu√©s viendo sus reglas no qued√≥ claro porque en su video dice que consiste en operaciones opuestas al mismo precio y al mismo tiempo, lo cual no hice pero me dijeron que contaba de todas formas. De estas infracciones tampoco tuve conocimiento hasta hoy ya que tampoco me notificaron ni nada. Simplemente me cerraron la cuenta.
Operaba con meta trader y migramos a ctarder, como no conoc√≠a esa plataforma hubieron algunas operaciones que me salieron mal por eso y termin√≥ resultando en la estrategia de cobertura. Una operaci√≥n a la alza dur√≥ 15 segundos y la cerr√© porque la hab√≠a puesto mal, abr√≠ otra a la baja ya que era la direcci√≥n que quer√≠a tomar desde el principio pero estuvieron abiertas al mismo tiempo por un lapso de 10 segundos y ya cont√≥ como una estrategia prohibida, lo mismo me pas√≥ en otra ocasi√≥n y ya fueron 2 infracciones de las que no me pude defender ni opinar.
Perd√≠ mi cuenta y no me enter√© hasta un mes despu√©s porque segu√≠a normal mi cuenta de ctrader y yo segu√≠a operando a diario. Me hab√≠an mandado un mail que no vi y eso fue todo, sin posibilidad de hablar ni nada. perd√≠ mi cuenta por errores que no debi√≥ ser as√≠ y solo me dicen que compre otra cuenta con descuento. ¬øC√≥mo voy a confiar en ellos? ni siquiera puedo hablar por las supuestas estrategias ni nada, ni siquiera pude hacer mi primer retiro, simplemente ya no tengo mi cuenta y no puedo comprar otra porque tampoco me van a reembolsar esta ni nada.
Puede que otras personas hayan tenido buena experiencia con esta empresa, pero no es mi caso y me dej√≥ mucho que desear.",

"It's a scam because if you make more profit then your withdraw target increase and not able to withdraw balance so keep in mind this is a scam....",

"se vengono rispettate le regole i pagamenti sono certi, almeno questa √® la mia esperienza",

"Why don't you go straight and just tell traders they need to hit a profit target to withdraw, why disguise it and call it trader value score, it's wickedness, if u trade 1:2 RR you will need 15R profits to hit 15% Trader value score which is frustrating, and u can't withdraw if u don't hit that 15% trader value score, it‚Äôs a trap, this is very evil",

"Trying this company again and getting used to the TVS rule this is my 4th attempt Hoping to continue to be successful and receive a payout I will do another review once I receive payout !!",

"Further to the complaint raised by me in my previous review, I was contacted by OFP team and they have reviewed my account and confirmed to offer a second chance with 50K80 6% DD account.
I appreciate the support extended by OFP team especially Mr. Raudel displayed professional way of dealing with customer.

I still recommend OFP to enhance their system by pausing the account to get the trader's attention when there first and second violation and re-activate once acknowledged by the trader.

Thank you OFP team",

"After failing funded account challenges, was about to drop the idea of trading forex, but OFP gave the light of hope. Thanks for giving opportunity, which most of the propfirm fails. At first I didn't believe the terms and conditions for Instant Funded Account. I can bet no other propfirm will be so lenient in terms of rules for INSTANT FUNDING. I started my journey with OFP, since Feb 2024, earlier the rules were pretty tough but as the time past by and OFP got earned their traders confidence, OFP started to drop 2 hard rules such as the 2-minute rule and the 3 trading days rule for a soft rule. The new TVS rule makes traders more discipline and prohibits one from gambling.",

"I have had a few accounts in the past with OFP which have made me a little more wiser. Most times the accounts had been violated due to a technical rule. I figured this time I would stick to a set of core rules such as only ever trading the same lot size, having the same opening pip stop loss, no scaling out or in, caution with trade selection. My thinking was to go over the top and see if this time I would qualify for a payout.
Yes it worked. I call it "Vanilla trading" meaning nothing fancy just really boring with little or no variance.
It almost makes you become more disciplned and focused on keeping the account really clean.
In other words KISS (Keep it simple stupid).
My account has the 15% TVR so once again you need to be careful with your average daily wins, this also helps you to be consistent.

On a side note support via email is quick and helpful.",

"Worst prop firms didnt give me my payout after I made $6500 on my account and was well below the TV's score and didn't break any rule",

"Very good company, everything is perfect and easy.
Highly recommended",

"just got payout again. thanks Ofp",

"Be careful of this scam of a company. I bought a 100K account (Order ID: OFP23256) and they told me they only offer cTrader, not MT5 and when I request for a refund, they totally ghost you and scam you of your money. If you give an honest review on Trustpilot, they report you in attempt to get your review deleted by Trustpilot. Thank God Trustpilot is independent and doesn't remove legitimate reviews. It's been a month now waiting for my refund and they just refuse to provide proof of payment. Please save yourself the heartache and STAY AWAY FROM THIS SCAM and find a trust worthy prop firm.",

"No really, they are literally redefining terms in order to put strikes against your account.
I used to reverse trade button on CTrader, they said I was hedging. When I told them it was a mistake they told me no you hedged.
I had to be a complete pain to get them to review it, when they did they told me I was right but the infractions will stay on my account.
When I ask why, they give this generic answer.

This is from their terms of service, the key phrase here is " Although this list does not include all tactics that can violate our trading policies, these are the most frequent ones we have observed traders trying to take advantage of demo accounts." This means that they can make up rules as they wish, as they did in my case. Using the reverse trade option on CTrader isn't against any rules on their website.

Avoid these guys, you will not get paid out.

Edit since their reply. Here is the conversation so you can see they are lying.

12:24 PM | Customer service from OFP: It is and although this list does not include all tactics that can violate our trading policies, these are the most frequent ones we have observed traders trying to take advantage of demo accounts.

12:25 PM | Visitor: Please remove the hedging violation from my record as you have admitted I didn't hedge. Thank you

12:26 PM | CS from OFP: It cannot be removed as it is not manually possible to open and close another trade at the same exact time

12:27 PM | Visitor: It is if you press the reverse button.

12:28 PM | Visitor: You can remove it or give me a refund. That's all I will accept.

12:29 PM | CS from OFP: It cannot be removed and the refund cannot be made since you have placed some trades on the account

12:29 PM | Visitor: I traded before you started cheating.

12:33 PM | CS from OFP: Okay, the buy trade and sell trade cannot be opened and closed at the same exact time and the refund on your account can't be made

12:33 PM | Visitor: Did I hedge?

12:33 PM | Visitor: No, so you are cheating.

12:33 PM | Visitor: take it off of my profile

12:35 PM | CS from OFP: The system flagged a buy and sell trade opened and closed at the same exact time without even a millisecond delay between them, that is still hedging

12:35 PM | Visitor: No it isn't.

12:36 PM | Visitor: You can't redefine the English language to suit your cheating.

12:37 PM | CS from OFP: Is there anything else I can help you with?

12:37 PM | Visitor: Yes, remove the lies from my account. Thank you


There is more but you can see I didn't admit to hedging as I didn't do it. CTrader opens and closes the positions at the same time if you hit reverse. Ninja trader closes first then opens. I didn't program these platforms I didn't know that and hedging is totally different anyway. Hedging is when you open a trade, it takes a loss and then you open the same trade in the opposite direction to avoid margin call. When the original trade turns green you close the second trade. Hitting the reverse button isn't even in the same ballpark.

If you trade with these guys you will regret it. Read all negative reviews. I wish I did before I paid.
It isn't a bunch of people crying about consistency or drawdown. There are legitimate gripes against this company changing rules and refusing payouts to legit traders.",

"I was sending a series of emails to the team as my first payout was getting delayed. As some technical issue which was happening got resolved someday before and I got my first payout and after that my 2nd payout got paid in just 2 days of time.

"The customer service is quick and top notch. Really helped me in getting back my account in order.",

"Worst experience I have ever had with a prop firm. I wanted to purchase an account and my card kept declining. They advised me to purchase the account using confirmo. I purchased the account with bitcoin. My cashapp confirmed that they received the bitcoin and I even provided the chain block which clearly confirms that they received the funds. They then started saying that the funds where moved after they received it. I tried to ask them to reverse the transaction or give me an account but they completely denied having received my funds and even stopped answering my emails. Please OFP stop doing this because am not the only one claiming that you have stollen their money using bitcoin. Refund my money, I have prove that you received my money and you are just thieves",

"Until now i cant open my account to trade on",

"Bien que les conditions soit assez accessible, il est important de noter OFP pr√¥ne la discipline car il y a un certaines mauvaises habitudes de trading qui sont restreints chez OFP.

"Great customer service",

"Worst trading platform. It's not at all trader friendly.. the TVS rule is just not trader friendly. If anyone thinking of buying an account please read the rules before buying because with the TVS rule in their. You can take swing trades or positional trades. Which is worst for any trader who is thinking of instant funding.If you gain more from single trade by taking a swing the TVs will shoot and you will not be able to take the payout at the end... Worst prop firm ever...",

"Thank you‚ù§ OFP
I have great faith in OFP, those who follow the rules get 100% payout from OFP, this is what I want to tell you from my experience, I got 2 payouts from OFP, those who were denied payout did not follow the rules of OFP, sometimes the payout is delayed, in my opinion they Working very hard. I tell you everyone who got payout give them 5 ‚≠ê I tell you to write your experience trust pilot, some don't write",

"This is my second review. I made a profit of 377 usd by scalping without violating daily drawdown and Max loss. My TVS score was also below required. But OFP denied me payout stating ilegal strategy. Very disappointed. I hold few of my trades for very short time this is the reason they gave. I used minimum lot my account size was 50k",

"I have had access to my funded account without any challenge. This was great to me and the account was handed over to me within a couple of minutes.
I cannot write much about payout because I'm not yet due to receive one. I'm hoping to receive when it's due.",

"AVOID. Unless your trade is immediately in profit, it's incredibly easy to hit their maximum daily limits. Your trade could drop a few pips then rocket in to profit, but if your equity drops below the limit for a split second your account is closed. Will not be using ofp again.

"Omg. I have never seen a more fraudulent company than this company in my life. They suspended my account for martingale when I never did. I showed them screenshot evidence from match trader that showed that I never martingaled. But these useless firm refused to reinstate my account. I made over $1800 in profit and then they fabricated a trade that‚Äôs my own even when my order history showed otherwise. Just run away from these company. I sent them various screenshots to show that I actually entered the same lot size for all the trades. 0.02 was the lot size I entered at those times they said I martingaled. The reason it came up as martingale was because I closed some of the trades in profits partially. Since when did closing partially become martingale. They are being so unreasonable and don‚Äôt even care atall. They even stopped responding. Just run away from these useless firms cause they‚Äôll take your money and fabricate your account for what you didn‚Äôt do when they see that you are profitable. It‚Äôs really hurtful cause I had made profit and I made sure not to break any rules. Even more hurtful cause I did not break the rules. I showed them all the screenshots and asked them to check the trade ID and see that I truly did not break the rules but they are so unreasonable. This is absolutely unfair. I‚Äôm considering suing the company because I honestly have the evidence that I did not break the rule.

I have provided all the evidence in your respective emails. Yet you keep insisting. Check your emails. I told you to check the trade ID as each order has unique trade ID. But there are 2 orders with the same trade ID and that was because one part was closed partially in profit which was the part you guys highlighted as martingale. The one that was closed partially. I showed you guys the open order and it was clearly he same as the other ones I entered",

"In fact I dont want to give any rating at all...They are not a genuine prop trading firm and forcing you to have TVS (Total value score) which is if you buy 10,000 account and on demand pay out with 3% MDL, 6% ML, 12% TVS and 80% pay out...You need to make highest profit of any single day and next 8 days below that highest profit so you can request for a pay out....Is it something hold ground in legal way? I am not sure...I am quite unhappy and thought once I reach 12% TVS i.e. $1,200 profit, I can request for a pay out of $960 but this is quite different methodology. Pls be cautious on these trading rules before buying the account...",

"This Trader value rule is wack..
Even if it must be there, why should it be a daily metric.
That rule is not transparent, neither is it for all type of consistent traders..
Consistency doesn't mean limiting the profits one makes by taking genuine risks..
It should rather be calculated based on individual trades not days..
Your trader value score is not cool at all..",

"Hello My Follow Traders..

Just to let the whole world know! There was an issue I reported here on Trustpilot about OFPFunding about my transaction been successfully wen I wanted to purchase an acct from them, But they didn't receive the funds, After a proper verification from my end and theirs it was concluded they didn't receive the funds it was a lost of funds due to the fact that the time got expired, They also gave me a 40% discount coupon for another purchase to show they also care about it and feel sorry for the inconvenient this have cause me. Thank you very much to the support manager and their online live chat that attended to me, it was a very stressful time for both path...I so much appreciate u guys in resolving this issue, I look forward in working with your company, God bless u.",

"Had a quick chat with George, who answered in a very friendly and helpful manner my question about the TVR score. Thanks!",

"Team is very responsive... I appreciate it.
Giving 3 star for following 2 reason which i personally dont think is good.

1. Trader Value Score should be atleast 25 % for consistency..

2. Its gambling rule is based on lot size traded.. Not on risk taken.. For example, if i trade in EurUsd 0.3 lot with 20 pip SL total risk taken 60 dollars, now in another trade I trade same pair with 1 lot with SL of 6 pip again risk taken is 60 dollars.. Here i took same consistent risk of 60 dollars according to my strategy but OFPfunding is considering this as a gambling... Which should not be there.. Gambling should be considering on basis of risk taken on trades not on lot",

"I've literally not used their service before..but I have a complaint while I tried to purchase their service. It's so sad they use a KYC partner site that wouldn't verify my identity and assume me fake 'cause I can't provide expensive documents LoL. I'm from Nigeria, and our general means of identification is our National Identification Number (NIN) Document. But their KYC partner site (Veriff) won't accept it instead they're requesting for a Drivers License, International Passport or Voters card to verify my Identity! The last time I checked, the verification is an Identity Verification Requirement. Not a Verification if I could drive, Travel internationally or if I could Vote! It's so crazy how you reject my NATIONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER DOCUMENT (NIN) for a Voters Card number or International Passport or Drivers License. I don't have a Car talkmore of the license to drive one neither have I traveled abroad before to have a international passport. So why don't you guys just make things easier. Maybe you communicate this with your KYC partner site or Transition to a different one that would Verify our Identity as a citizen of our country not try to verify if we can drive, vote, or travel internationally this makes no sense. I saw OFP's ad on Instagram and I'm like whoa instant funding really? Since I won't have to undergo any hectic challenge to get funded and rather get access to funding immediately after purchase was the reason I tried checking them out. I signed up and had to verify my KYC before I purchased an account this morning. Since I figured it won't verify me and rather call me a robot cause I can proof my identity as a Nigerian but can't proof my right to drive, vote or travel internationally LoL üòÇ reason i didn't bother purchasing the account anymore. I actually reached out through their live chat and their support team said their KYC partner site doesn't accept our NATIONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER DOCUMENT (NIN) even though we'd be taking a selfie right after. I just can't imagine...

One thing for you all at OFP Team, Yes you may not need my little change, but you lost a customer today. I suppose you'd understand..please and please I'd appreciate you all at OFP consider we Nigerians and Verify our Identity as Citizens/Humans and not our rights to drive, vote or travel internationally. Thanks in anticipation for considering my concern with your service.",

"I lost my account over an alleged "Martingale" violation.

Their rules say you get 2 warnings and on the 3rd time your account is closed.

On the 2nd of August I opened 3 trades for XAUUSD, 3 different lot sizes. This was their explanation for the violation:

"The account was flagged for martingale
The lot size were increased
As an explanation, Martingale trading is adding a higher lot size (increasing) the lot size, while any position on the same symbol, in the same direction is in loss, negative. Kindly note that it doesn‚Äôt matter the amount of loss the previous/most recent position is in. As long as it‚Äôs in loss and a bigger lot size is opened on the same symbol and same direction. This falls under martingale violation. You may open a position with the same lot size while in loss or a smaller lot size than your most recent position. If you want to open a position with a bigger size. Your most recent position should be in positive/profit or closed."

I explained I opened 3 trades one after the other not thinking about whether the previous positions were in profit or not, and proceeded to remind them that this had only happened this once. That this should count as a warning, not a violation, as they claim you get 2 warnings first.

Then support said that all trades happened on the same day, so that was it. Those were my 3 chances?!!!

In other words they say you get 2 warnings first but you don't. Account was closed on first violation, a violation that I wasn't even aware of until 3 days later when out of the blue it showed my account was violated.

It's a shame as this prop firm has a lot of potential, this has really put me off. This should have been a warning, as they say this would be, instead of arbitrarily closing my account on the very first violation.

Yes, all trades happened on the same day, but there was only 1 Martingale violation. Unless there is more than one trade there can't be a Martingale violation to begin with.

Update: I never heard back from support. They never looked into this issue even though they commented they would here. This company is either dishonest or inconsiderate to their traders... or both.

A huge disappointment. They have a model that could turn them into the biggest prop firm out there but if they keep operating this way their reputation will keep tanking. I can already see general score has gone from 4.2 (when I found them) to 3.9 at the time of writing this update.",

"My experience has been made great because of the consistency aimed rule of payout of the Trader value index which is courages consistency",

"The Prop firm OFP funding is very very good prop firm",

"After making profit, i cant withdraw
they keep telling me i have not not reached my % TVS , which was not part of the rules stated",

"Don't listen to the bot reviews, I am a trader and I wouldn't recommend due to their badly motivated 'TVR' rule, they basically call it their way of tracking consistency in traders and you have to be under the TVR% to request any payouts. This 'innovative' rule is mainly affected by the amount of Daily Drawdown (DD) you want on the account. If you buy the most expensive (5% DD) the TVR is 20%, so I worked out that means you have to make aleast 17.5% profit in order to get a withdrawal. If you are a trader then you know this means you have to be aggressive; being aggressive + small account + wanting more money = blowing account + more money spent on blown accounts = more money for CEO. Or you can consistently trade for a few years and then get a payout I guess. And the TVR for the cheapest account 3% DD is 12% which means more...
Without them being money hungry with this TVR, it would be a great firm maybe just add a 5% prof target rule instead. Be safe peeps, bless.",

"Horrible company. Instant withdrawal? They have a rule of your biggest winning day being less than 20% of total profits accrued, and minimum 4 day rule. Avoid at all costs. Their rules are there without your knowledge, and they are only there to make you fail and not get paid. Absolute crap company. Stick to the real reputable funded accounts to avoid these headaches!",

This is second time OFP says to me.
Always use an not objective reason "your profits were made by taking advantage of a feed delay" to not pay profits to traders,
I found out that many people have had to endure the same reason.

So TRADER, you buy an account, you trade,
And after having profit, you will got above reason to not receive payment.
You are losing money in terrible way.

In this scam industry but again really disappointed!

I dedicatedly traded in ofp account and just when I wanted payout , their dashboard wrongly says martingale! I always open two trades with different lot for tp1 and tp2 and they have added random trade as martingale.
If this is martingale , then all trades should have been marked the same from starting bt I have been using it from 2 months and just before payout this is what their dashboard says!
Everyone in customer service says team will check and review but why does this happens before payout order only??

Really disappointed ! 1000519 is my account !",

"After I was unhappy with the quality of trade execution & some features with the new cTrader platform I asked if this could be swapped to the Match Trader platform. Unfortunately this was not available.

I must admit the Online Chat is quite quick, certainly better than being on the phone, but unfortunately responses can be quite poor & get to a dead end quickly

I noticed the trade execution time was quite a bit slower on cTrader vs Match Trader, and spreads seemed hugely different, as OFP had advertised cTrader was the best.
I'm not sure but this seemed drastically slower than Match Trader

I asked them for OFP's complaints procedure, given this is required by law in the UK, I was surprised that they didnt respond whether via their support Email or online Chat both of which I messaged on more than occassion

I wanted to follow up further and if no response after 8 weeks then I will be putting in a complaint to the Financial Ombudsman as I feel this was false advertising about the quality of cTrader and poor customer service that they did not atleast give a partial refund or offer to give discount on buying another account.

Now yes OFP.. I understand that a refund or swap would have been possible if I hadn't used or placed a trade (according to the refund policy) yet how would I have known about the poor trade execution and reality of the spreads unless I had placed trades?

This seems illogical, invalid and possibly against the UK 7 or 14 day returns legislation.

Denying of where or how to make an offical complaint to the company is against UK law

I look forward to hearing from you so that I may be able to put a formal complaint to OFP and follow it up if needed with action to the Financial Ombudsman (FCA.gov)

Update (A reply to OFP's reply)
I have a (marketing) email saying that the new cTrader platform is managed all in house? Which does seem to go against your reply below. I had to ask a few times but finally got your complaints procedure from OFP chat, but when I said I had an issue as an 'active' customer you couldn't seem to help me, yet when I was asking info about purchasing an account I then got a response.. Now I may have been unfortunate to who replied to me but this is what I would consider poor customer service, unfortunately.

Also I got info from your chat that only 3 traders (thats 3.0 for people reading) have had payouts consistently over 12 months, and that currently payouts were at 14% of accounts purchased. Now I appreciate the risks and issues involved but I feel this needed to be highlighed to others before purchasing, whether what you do as a company can improve this for people I dont know but I think its worth others knowing",

"At the beginning I was sceptical, after some initial hitches in understanding some rules well everything went well as the first payment, now I hope to continue because if what I saw turns out we could find ourselves faced with a large propfirm. The fact of not having to doing challenges helps a lot",

"I just came across your website and am impressed. Looking to sign up an account today",

"bad server, tvs very worse than the profit target. becarefull with this company",

"This prop firm said my strategy is no consistency lot size because I place 0.11 lot btc and 3.4 lot eth.
The price of btc is 60k and eth is 3k so to manage risk, I must calculated risk per trade so lot size is different. They don't understand the gap of crypto price.",

don't be fool with the cheap price and cheap fraud company.

"I was very cautious when trying OFP so I created a small account to test them out, there is no challenge to pass to get your funded account, however you do need to meet the consistency rule in order to receive a payout, it can be tempting to go in bigger on big moves, but staying consistent with your daily PnL pays off in the long run here.

I achieved my first payout today, I was contacted first thing this morning saying that I had reached the payout threshold and the money was in my bank account within 2 hours (UK bank transfer). I wanted to wait to receive a payout before posting any review and I am very happy to have chosen OFP to trade with.",

Bueno, pues me avisan que eso es apuesta, que venga Dios y lo vea. esta es mi experiencia de momento, a la espera de fecha de cobro. Ya contar√© como me va. De momento con enfado, pues llevo meses operando y me avisan ahora.",

"OFP is 1000% SCAM, do not trust them, everything will work smoothly till the day payout, and they come up with a "Risk team" with their fake and inappropriate reviews. they don't even know the point size and point value of each asset, or they pretend they don't know, and they send you the screenshots that compare your positions with sizing issues, however sizing issues or sizing rules are not displayed anywhere on their website to clients dashboard, but at that time they will pull out their terms and conditions, and say we don't have specific rule on sizing issue, it is not our rule, but we don't accept the drastic change in sizing, and it our recommendation and idea to our traders to keep the good sizing behavior.
so, is it a rule or not?
In conclusion, OFP doesn't pay, even if you did not fail any of their rules, they will come up with a new rule, an idea, or a recommendation that they even know for sure that is not a rule of theirs.",

"This company is fraudulent and it's a scam. A friend traded the first Month (April 2024) after he bought at account and when it's was day to payout they said he broke their rules by trading different lot sizes and he was told that they would close his account if it happens again. The next month (May 2024) he made a profit of $3.6k and they refused him his payout with different excuses of trade reviews that never comes to an end. Because he kept requesting a payout they blocked him from their platform",

"They wrote in their description: If any account is seen to be using unfair strategies or an unrealistic trading style their account will be suspended.

That is really an idiotic rule. Why? Because with this statement, OFP can close every account which is in profit, if they don‚Äòt want to make payouts.

The worst case is, that they marker your account as ‚Äûgambling‚Äú. 1. you can trade without a Stop-Loss. 2. if you See the Trade is going against you und you use the chance to go out of this Trade with no los, but with 10 USD, they they marker your account as ‚Äûgambling‚Äú.

But there is no gambling, because you rescued the money. In this case they want to See that you close your trade in loss.

I know, that they will answer with ignorance and only ‚ÄûBlabla‚Äú in the same way as they have done with the other ratings with one star.

"I am speechless! Two days ago, I received two separate emails from OFP regarding hedging and martingale violations. What confuses me is that I received the payout on 14/06. Violations happened before 07/06, in the payout email, I got a one time warning of violation and was notified that if it happens again, my account would be closed. Since then, I frequently monitor my account and Hedging/Martingale violation always shows ‚Äú0‚Äù.

Now my account was suddenly closed because of the violation. Why did they make the payout then? when I requested a payout on 11/06, it showed "0" violation in my account, why? You know, from 11 to 14 June, they spent three days reviewing and investigating my account. Speechless! They change their rules arbitrarily. Is it intentionally misleading?

Detailed Information:
11/06, one of the OFP staff helped me with the payout request. I sent the support team a screenshot of ‚Äú0‚Äù violation on that day.

14/06, I received my first payout with a one time warning about hedging behaviour. I was told that if such trading behaviour occurred again, my account could be closed.

26/06, my account was closed. The reason was hedging and martingale violation. The latest violation date provided was 07/06/2024.",

"OFP really a SCAM like MFF.
This's the 4th time and lastime also I write review for OFP. Yes, my fist time they payed out me on time like others, then I bought 4 more accounts, Of course this is a trick for you to buy new accounts. I spent some months then get pay out but OFP did not do it. They give so many reasons like: slow system, risk team was analysing....... without feedback to me. 28 next days finished they even didn't email me any information. I continue to trade untill now, got profit and wait for pay out, OFP stated that my trading strategy is illegal while I trade only currency such as GBPUSD, EURUSD...what ?????
so the last time I advise new trader if you see my comment please stay far away OFP and don't purchase any money with OFP because OFP will die soon and you will loss your money soon with them.",

"I have used this Company, they pay.....but have a couple of different rules from other Prop Firms, such as, their Consistency Rule. You may be in profit and want a payout but your profits are not constant. If you make $200 per day then no problem with this rule, but if you make $500 one day and $50 the next, this Rule will penalize you. Make sure you understand the implications of this Rule.
Another issue is they do not use MT4 or MT5.
Final issue is they do not allow you to use a Copy Trader to trade from another Broker or Prop Firm. This is an issue for me as I have accounts with other Prop Firms and would just like to copy these onto my OPF account.
Otherwise OFP Funding is considered safe and will pay

But if you are profitable and consistant trader, you will start to understand the scam step by step.
More OFP understand you are consistant, more they will transform your trading to a difficult job.
Bad dashboard.
Bad trading conditions : you have to limite your big win day to 25% of total profit.
Bad support.
Bad spreads (don't relay to the spreads communicated in ofp website, reality is on trading plateformes).
If you are a profitable trader ofp will find a way to not give you a payout.
Business model supported by the traders fail only.
They put uk address of their office in the website. It can be true. But also it is possible that they are located in myanmar.

"The 1 star reviews made me worried that they might scam me. But those people just broke the rules and are talking nonsense. Ofp paid me. They will pay you if you follow their rules",

"If there was a way to rate OFP with no stars I would. I started my journey with OFP February 23rd of 2024. I lost a couple of accounts because I didn't understand their rules. When I finally understood their accounts and started trading, using strategies that they acknowledge are legitimate, they denied me a payout when I was due one. No matter what I said or did they stood firm and did not pay me out. They then gave me a new account on a different platform and I traded that one too. When it was time for me to get my payout for this account as well, they denied me a payout once again, coming up with vague and ambiguous reasons to deny my payout. When I challenged them on their reasons they stopped communicating with me altogether. OFP to me is a fraudulent firm and they do everything they can to prevent traders from being paid out. In both instances when they denied my payouts, they flexed me as one of the top performers on their leaderboard and yet when I requested payouts (a process that typically takes 24 hours), they took almost a week to respond and then always ended up breaching my account after the fact offering spurious reasons for doing so.

This is not an organization I would recommend to even my worst enemy because all they want to do is take your money and then when you're due payouts come up with unfounded reasons to breach your account and deny your payout.",

"Scammers of the highest order. Do not trust the 5 star reviews. They regularly run a campaign offering opportunity to win free accounts for leaving a review on TrustPilot. Read the 1 and 2 star reviews for the truth of this Company.

Many traders, myself included have been refused payouts based on some dreamt up reasons. They falsely accuse traders of abusing slow data feeds, something traders cannot control. They refused my payout of over 4000 USD, accusing me of abusing lot sizes. How can I be abusing lot sizes when my trading risk is between 0.5%-1%?

To make matters worst, they have started to migrate traders from MT4/5 to cTrader and MatchTrader. These platforms are completely different from MT4/5, so unless you already have experience of these platforms, it is reckless to start trading for real on these, as no doubt mistakes will happen, which will either result in loss of payout or account closure. Yet, they fail to acknowledge this as an issue and refuse to refund the accounts, which they must do as these new platforms is not what most traders signed up for.

No doubt, they will respond to this review with reference to their trader agreement, and claims to paying out etc. Their trader agreement is a piece of garbage written probably by a school leaver as critical parts of it are so vague and subject to individual interpretation.

Anyway, not going to waste people's time with a lengthy review, but I would say, avoid this firm at all costs. Read the 1 star reviews. Join their Discord and see for yourself what issues other traders are having. They claim they are the best funding firm. They are not. If you know how to trade, it is best to go with a futures prop firm where you can get same size accounts for a fraction of the cost, and after completing the single phase challenge, get access to REAL funds, not some demo garbage.

Typical response, referring to the FAQ's and terms and conditions. You should study your own t&c's. Your t&c's regarding lot size change is vague and open to interpretation. It does not state as a matter of fact, what is considered to be unacceptable change in lot size. Professional traders trade with managed risk of 0.5% - 1%, which is what I do, so my lot changes accordingly. Your response regarding futures firms, I trade with a futures prop firm. Their trading conditions are a lot better than yours which are designed to fail traders. FunderPro is a forex prop firm, they give live accounts with REAL money after passing the challenge, so you are wrong to imply that all prop firms are demo accounts. With regards to reviews, it is human nature that if you are offering opportunity to win a free account for leaving a review, people will leave only positive reviews. You think OFP is great, but your Discord channel is so toxic with complaints from other traders, whose profits you have robbed by twisting words from your so called t&c's.

"I just started with OFP when the Prop firm Industry began it's regulation of US citizens. I have since refered several of my friends to the firm and we all have had great Experiences so far. The concept of payouts being deposited into a broker is very intriguing.

Looking forward to the challange.",

"Am very grateful to be part of the OFP family.
I have a lot of good experiences to share. First of all they are fast in delivering account details, fast in support services, they have no hidden rules, their accounts types are very friendly for everybody because they have four-tier profit share :80%,60%,40% and 26% and also have different account sizes for the average trader unlike the others with only one way profit share payment. Also, I did not get my profit target(trader value) for 3 months but am still trading, that is a plus my contract would have been terminated if it were to be other prop firms.
However, my issues are with the trader value because it limits the profitability of the trader, is like you are confined to some corner. The market does not move the same distance everyday, it consolidates and trends and even within the trend sometimes it moves far than other times but because of trader value rule you are forced to close your profitable trades in other not to increase it. If am in a trade that can give me 3k profit am forced to close it at $500 or $700 because I will be thinking of how to make $3000 x 4+ before i can get withdrawals. The forex market does not work like that. Everybody has his/her own strategy and should be allowed to trade freely.
There should also be room for upgrading of accounts and profit share percentages: I.e if I have $200 only today to purchase 25k account there should be a room where i can top up the balance in future to increase the size to 50k, 100k etc and if I purchased 25k -40% profit share, I should be able to top up later if I like to 60% or 80% by simple paying the remaining balance between 40% share and 60% etc.
In fact, apart from these few observations, they are the best prop firm in the market.
I love you OFP and i hope my observations would be taken in good fate and acted upon.
Thank you

"OFP always finds ways to not have to pay traders. They just robbed my account and my profits because 2 orders did not exist. They make the rules and don't follow the rules they make. A two-faced man. Everyone should stay away from this scam OFP fund if they do not want to lose money unjustly
I have full picture proof of their fraud. Contact me if anyone needs it",

"I am waiting for my payout for over 2 weeks. First they said they didn't get my email (really?). Then the support told me that they were delayed. The payout should be processed within 24-48 hours. It's a on-demand-account. My profit is still published on the payout list on the homepage. Do they advertise with profitable traders but do not pay them? If I ever get my payout I will update this post.",

"I am AHMEDFX from Morocco.
I joined OFP since 2022 and received many payouts without the slightest problem.
OFP is such a great company that it has revolutionized the funding industry in the Forex market.
OFP offers instant funding accounts without any challenges or verifications. The nice thing is that its account prices are affordable for everyone, and its accounts are also available in different models and with a profit split of up to 80%.
OFP is an opportunity for every trader who seeks to change his life for the better, but on the condition that he respects all applicable rules.
I love the unique OFP model.",

"Mi experiencia fue muy buena, tuve dos cuentas, la primera romp√≠ una regla que debo confesar no supe interpretar.. Quiz√°s deber√≠an redactarla de una manera clara, a prueba de tontos como decimos ac√°.
De los errores aprendemos, asi que en mi segunda cuenta, ya con las reglas entendidas, todo fue diferente.
Yo lo √∫nico que recomiendo es seguir las reglas a raja tabla y todo va a estar bien.

"Well I feel that the company has scammed me i made 1200 in profit not one losing trade out off 10 but still closed my account because 5% drawdown how does that make sense anything to close the account ..... so yes it is a scam they are now saying they use open trades as a drawdown and not when you close the trade tell me this is not a SCAM",

"Simply they are a scum, dont fall in to the sweet word they say. DO NOT get any account with them ( I do not normally give any negative feedback to a business, unless it is too bad). When my account is in profit and and it is looking good for pay out ( it is 29th April), now they have deactivated my account. I have asked them why, they said I have breached Martingale rules. I have asked them to give me proof, they have given me some screenshot that has happened in February, But I am trading all this time, they didnt tell me anything( What a waste of my 2 months). My dashboard was always showing that my account did not breach any rules. But suddenly they are giving me screen shot from 2 months ago and deactivated my account. And the fact is instead of putting a 0.12 lot I put 0.1 lot by typing mistake and than I added another 0.11 lot. It is a common sense that this is a typing mistake and it will not affect anything.

I paid hard earned money for a service but they have failed to provide the service or offer any compensation or refund.

Is the MT4 issue my problem? This is just ridiculous to say the least.

"Serious Traders. If you view trading as a business this is a firm you want to stay away from.
1. They only pay to personal accounts

Issue
Tax purpose issues dependant on your area will have a personal tax issue Personal:15% - 25% then Provincial and Federal: 25% - 45%.

If I‚Äôm responsible for my own taxes but OFP doesn‚Äôt give you an option then they actually don‚Äôt see you as business signs of ponzi.

Situation: You‚Äôre consistently profitable (4 Payout) 5% - 10% each
200k Account with 80% Profit Share
You make $48,000 in 1 year.

You go do your taxes and instead of reaping the rewards of tax breaks Ex. Writing off expenses Operational: (Internet, Work Space, Hardware, Challenge Accounts or Account Expenses (Trading View, Data Fees, etc) you miss out on the tax breaks.

Aside from the business optics, you now have to pay higher taxes on your profit. Your $48,000 is $30,000 or less.

Traders beware. Key Note: Different countries with different rules. The point is how are you suppose to do taxes on potential large sums of money (If your consistently profitable) and what are you actually earning after your payout after you report.

When asked why, they said company policy. I can only imagine trying to receive a payout and what kind of rules they have tucked away for you to deal with.",

"Cheap for a reason. OFP has a fantastic business model but do be warned it does not reflect the real trading environment. I have had a few accounts with them, one in the early days when they had some crazy rules and now in more recent times with much friendlier rules. Warning to traders do not use any form of EA and yes it is written in their T&C's however who would have thought using a Trade Management EA that simply helps you place a trade and manage the position is reason enough to have a 200K account declined. Yes it's all within their rules but this is like jaywalking and being put in prison. Anyway I guess this is how they make money by taking my +2K and giving it to traders who keep it real simple. never again. A fair review of the EA Trade manager would be appricatted.",

"Scam company
Bad service they have for many hidden rules in the terms and conditions page that are deliberately set to hold and reject payments like they sent me an email telling me I opened another position with a bigger position than my first position and I didn't see that when I read the rules

"I have been accused of copy trading by OFP. While I trade completely alone. I do not trade with signals. They sent me 2 pictures of another random account with similar trades and said they were proof. Just when I was about to receive a payout. they wanted to appropriate the money I bought the account for.
They gave you a reward If you put 5 stars here, in trustpilot.

Account number: 2140318193",

"My second account with OFP is not on the dashboard and customer support unable to resolve.

The OFP support team has asked for order ID and payment proof with last 4 digit of card. I have provided all the evidence.

On top of this, this second account can be seen LIVE on the trading platform and I have also sent this to the OFP team.

Despite all the evidence, the OFP support team is still not able to resolve the issue, and said they have to refer to their manager.

There is no issue with trading this second trading account, but I am not able to view it on my dashboard. I can only view my first account.

In addition, it is almost impossible to access the dashboard. It is either very slow or totally not able to open the page.

###

Subsequent to earlier review, it seems like the OFP billing team has mixed up the payments. I have made payment for my first account number 593640 on 4 April and my second account number 594796 on 10 April. However, the OFP billing team said that the 10 April payment proof is for my first account (which is clearly wrong). I have provided them with payment proof of my first account dated 4 April and are awaiting their reply.",

"I tried to avoid to write here, but in the end I had to. 04/10/2024 I tried to buy a 25K account, made the payment, but did not receive any confirmation except the page with a ‚Äútick‚Äù that the payment was completed. I soon noticed that instead of $332.25 the payment was $104.25 and immediately wrote to the support service about it. Each response from the service took a long time, the operators changed, and each time I had to explain everything in a new way and send a bank statement with the payment. In the end, the operator George told me that I would receive an e-mail with an underpayment, but to date I have not received it, which I wrote to the same George. He told me today to wait until he clarified the issue, and when a couple of hours passed in silence, I asked again, and some Raudel answered me, who simply said that there was no any payment and they didn‚Äôt owe me anything. $124 dollars is not a lot of money, but if the propcompany refuses to return them, then the conclusion arises that things may be going very badly for them. I hope this post will help someone save their money. OFP - is the worst experience in my life.

Update: They still "...look into this matter further"..... It's really terrible.",

"I have been accused of copy trading by OFP. While I trade completely by myself. They sent me 2 pictures of another account and said they were proof. I don't understand why they send any pictures and call it evidence? Obviously they wanted to appropriate the money I bought the account for. That's a lot of money for me. 100% correct, they appropriated it.
NOTE THAT THE 5-STAR RATINGS THEY GET ARE THERE BEHAVIOR OF BUYING CUSTOMERS BY OFFERING DISCOUNT PROMOTIONS IN RETURN YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM A 5-STAR RATE.",

"OFP IS A SCAM. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. MOST OF THE 5 STAR REVIEWS ARE VERY FAKE. One you trade a demo account and not an instant live account like they say. They will steal your strategy if you're profitable and they have so many hidden rules to trick you and block your account. I was up 5% profit but they still blocked my account total scam.",

"Cheating company, they said that they only have little bit rules and you can easier to have funding and payout, when you have once time of the martingale trading , they will say that you have 11times and violate their rules, they will only try their best to close your account and get your money, please don‚Äôt buy their account anymore, and they are a cheating and scam company",

"I was highly disappointed with thier recent services. The dashboard continued to freeze and the worst of it all is their new broker charging $200plus for one lot of bitcoin. Give the traders what they deserve. Acct num 592204",

"For starter, any funding company who provides a demo account for instant funding has alternate motives. Why? because whatever profit a trader makes has to be paid by the company as it is not real money account, so they are actually rooting for your failure, and they will be hunting for any mistakes to take you out. so from now onwards, i want to trade with people who want me to make money and take a share from it as commission unlike firms like OFP.",

"They use one of the most manipulative and dishonest brokers around.
No respect for price action!
I formulate my trades off trading view for better view and more tools, and its been my unfortunate experience that many times, price will reach a certain level on a pair, but this broker holds price at a different level, perhaps to force you to close in loss, or to hit sl. For example, trading xauusd, price reached a low of 2328, at this price i placed a buy order. on tradingview within 15 mins the price was back up to 2346, however this broker held the price at below 2328 for the 15 mins, until they had no choice but to bring the price up to match the market, however slowly.

With respect to the prop firm itself, the Trader Score Value, is one of the most ridiculous rules i've come across. I understand the concept is to keep traders consistent. but sometimes that just not the case there are days you will lose, and there are days you will be more profitable. in this case they want you to be less profitable. lets say you're on a 10k account, and your target is $300 profit daily, but one day you happen to make $600, sorry but you just screwed yourself, because now your Trader score is above 20, and you will be unable to withdraw any profit until you have a score of below 20...

this company is a scam, and just want to take your money unfortunately.",

"Scam company, they accuse me of having done martingale which is not true, the reality is that they do it many days after I closed operations, when they saw that I went from being negative to being profitable and the payment date was approaching. Don't buy it even with a 90% discount.",

"SCAM. They got kicked off their last broker, and moved to a new one, with days of downtime and no email communication. Had to chase the 'new logins' 4 times, every day being promised they would be ready by the end of the day.

Worst of all, they have a bunch of opaque rules and will simply cancel your account to stop you getting a withdrawal. They give no warning. E.g. their UI has a martingale warning. My account, which apparently violated this rule, has no warnings at all for martingale or any other violations. The CS staff said "The UI is not yet connected to identify martingale in the trading account. Work is currently ongoing:" So you can't trust their UI.

Midway through discussing this, the agent just disappeared from the chat. Their reps are all curt, almost to the point of rude.

I strongly believe these are another prop firm scam fund",

"Cheat. They introduce hidden rules that lead to violations.",

"Me gusta la empresa y la recomiendo",

"Scam. They accused me of using Martingale and closed my account (2140317879), while the company has its own interpretation of Martingale: according to the generally accepted definition, Martingale involves doubling (!) subsequent trades when the initial trade goes into a loss.
I opened one trade with a volume of 0.30, and later another with a volume of 0.40 lots, i.e. the increase was 33%, not a doubling, and each of the positions was closed at different times and on different days. OFP called it Martingale.
Another situation is when, having a long-term trade with a volume of 0.02, which is at a loss (I am primarily a swing trader), I wanted to add a trade, but mistakenly, using my phone, I selected a volume of 0.5 and opened a trade, but immediately noticed the error and closed trade at a loss(!) in just 42 seconds! OVP called it Martingale.
None of these situations are in any way consistent with the Martingale system, but the OFP, ignoring all these arguments, states that I used Martingale, but not the one that all traders know about and the essence of which is described in many sources, but their interpretation of Martingale, with no explanation of their version of the Martingale anywhere on their website, and the OFP refused to reactivate the account.
Unless otherwise stated on the site, each trader is guided by generally accepted concepts and definitions of trading strategies and tactics, therefore the OFP distorts generally accepted definitions in such a way that one can ‚Äújustify‚Äù the deactivation of a trading account and misappropriate the money paid for it. They should put on the website not Martingale, but "OFPntingale", or something like that.
All of the above can be confirmed with screenshots

UPD. One week passed - no response...

UPD2. 20 days passed - no response. They only politely answer here and promise to sort out the situation, but in reality they do not want to give up easy, essentially stolen, money. I categorically do not recommend OFP; do not risk your money by giving it to a company-scamer.",

REVIEW UPDATE:
Since this kind of advertising may mislead new traders of the real value of this (and any) prop firm, I reduce the 5 to 3 stars. A real positive review is only helpful after a real account trading and a real time company testing.",

"Just exploring this platform since a few days, it offers an scalable trading experience, with x100 leverage on any plan, it can be a good opportunity to grow a seed capital.",

"This is my second review of OFP. My first experience, getting started, was 100% positive. Getting the account set-up and getting started was simple and easy. I had a small question that was answered and resolved promptly. My account is currently profitable, so when the industry was shaken by changes within Metatrader, I became nervous and concerned. However OFP made the transition to our new platform, seamless, efficient and problem free. Not only am I pleased with how OPF conducts their business, but want to express my appreciation. In my opinion, in the prop firm industry OFP should be your go to company. No need to look elsewhere!",

"OFP big scam they not give withdrawal during withdrawal Time They just show violation without any reason and not give withdrawal so be aware of this platform.
Also they set TVR so if you can't reach it means you can't request for withdrawal if reach this value 25% then show one violation and block your account. One of the most scammer prop firm in history so be aware and don't buy any plan.",

"The honesty of the support staff. I have blown accounts due to greed. I have put up an argument that the daily drawdown reconciliation should be done at midnight 00:00 and not the second after one go over the 5% limit. My argument is that it is called a daily drawdown and not a hourly or every moment drawdown. I still hope it will by reviewed by ofp. I am about to open another account though to get the 30% less offer while still available. OFP is still a better option according to my assessment",

"I was so excited to buy a 100k account especialy that it is instant funding and the company seems legit, I used to work with ftmo and made alot of money there but im tired of passing challenges.

luckily I watched the video about the trader value rule and immediatly saved my self from trouble. They must know that market is full of trouble and market is not stable and sometimes a good day can wipe out many bad days and this is how market works, with this rule it will be almost impossible to withdraw any profits and I think it works best for them so they can retain the fees you pay for them without having to loose not even a portion of the money they make in the form of payouts.",

"RELIABLE PROP FIRM",

"Everything the company does well except the company's main website often crashes",

"Initial experience was great but.... Response from support has been fast, accounts have been easy to setup with credentials sent promptly. They dealt with the sudden broker challenge and emergency switch over well in my opinion. My only gripe is a big one. It is that I was advised to use a trade copier by OFP support, using my other OFP account as a master, as accounts can not be merged - sounded fair. I did my due diligence and it was not specified anywhere, either in the email from support, the trading rules, or the TCs, that I had to email support first with the details of the master and copy account and tool used. Subsequently, taking the seemingly well meant advice from OFP support has resulted in the closure of the 25k copy account, which feels extremely unfair and it felt like support was completely inflexible when provided with the email trail. But I like their model and I hope we can work to a better outcome.

Update: There's some confusion amongst OFP support around the contrast between trading rules and something that is answered in their lengthy FAQs. What's worse is that I'm being denied an escalation process by front line support to get senior eyes on the matter which, in my opinion at least, is a legal risk to any company selling a finance product in the UK. I do not subscribe to OFP being scammers at all. I'm invested in our joint success, but some of these, albeit fairly young policies, T&C's and approaches really do need senior attention.

Final update: No follow-up from OFP to the comment on this review after a month. So, I'm left to assume this was for show. When re-raised with support, the support manager referred me to the original response from support and asserted that no EAs are allowed - even though Social Trader Tools, (which is advocated as a copy tool) is an EA. The 1 star score mostly reflects my experience with the closed account, which resulted from their poor instruction on Copy trading my own OFP accounts, and an unwillingness to recognised that the situation emanated from this. Still, at the time of this review, nowhere does it say that not emailing your details to support prior to copying your other accounts will end in account closure.",

"I have experienced trading that feels very good.",

"Good communication and fast service",

"Good platform",

"Excellent experience with OFP from day one. Responsive and available with any question I have. Great programs and good prices. Easy to use dashboard. Everything has been seamless, even through the recent shake-up in the industry. Expecting my first payout this month. Highly recommend!",

"Easy Setup but Support is slow and Dashboard is very poor.",

"Support helped me out

After purchase I got the login very fast.
After 2 days I had an issue with the MT5 connection to the dashboard which was solved by the support team now, so I can continue the journey....",

""Hello everyone. I advise against trading on this platform. They will never pay your gains. I started with them on 13/02, and by 01/03/24, I had realized a total of 7.24% returns. On 03/03/24, the payout date was supposed to be, but they postponed it to 04/03/24, citing an excuse from 02/03/24. This morning, at 6:51 on 03/03/24, I received an email saying my account was breached. They claim it's because I was scalping, even though their platform claims to accept all trading styles, including scalping. They breached my account just because I scalped. If you haven't deposited funds on this platform yet, honestly, don't. I've traded on instantfunding.io without any issues and always received my payments. This is my first experience with this platform, and I realize they are thieves."",

The dashboard then shows a daily reset after 12midnight (Singapore time). So I took a trade, it says I violated my 5%, meaning my minor drawdown affected the last day's limit.

If there was no reset why does the dashboard do that? Knowing we depend on our dashboard for critical information apart from the trading platform.

"very good OFP models because there is no monthly fee and you can do the trading without any pressure.",

"OFP is a great prop firm because of the 3 following reasons:
1. Instant funding
Once you purchase an account, you can start making money immediately, no need to pass challenges with a lot of stressful period
2. Discipline training
Many traders think the Trader Value Score is frustrating but I have a different perspective: it is essential for a stable profit & strategy. This rule will help traders to practice discipline and become consistently profitable

Si quieres invertir en una empresa lo primero que tienes que hacer es leer y analizar las reglas, si t√∫ forma de operar es incompatible con las reglas no inviertas en esa compa√±√≠a. Esto es un consejo para todas las personas que opten por cualquier empresa, despu√©s no violen algo y digan que es una estafa.",

My opinion
Ofp is perfect trading funded account because no profit targets and no demo or challenge phases and of course best supporting side. Best trading broker (no slipping trade) trading broker very important in trading life

My earnings
January 29th my first payout day. I received my payout money my Indian country bank. I received profit ¬£1765.9 ($2222.00). And I earned best polite support. And of course trusted trading funded program. I trust ofp

trading experience
Trading is not a gambling so don't take very bad trades. Because we know some ofp rules so don't take too risk. Every trade time you should be carefully analyze day limit loss and total limit loss. Please trade best trading possession (only trade profit confirmation time)

Rules
Never lose maximum day loss and maximum loss. So mostly use correct stop-loss. TVR rules very important in ofp funded account. TVR% is your payout thing . Not too much of rules in OFP FUNDED PROGRAM (only 3 rules)

Personally I very much of love ofpfunding. Because I truly enjoyed and I feels so protective supporting side. Very best trading broker. Very excellent experience. Thank you for everything. Thanks ofpfunding.

I only one complaint in ofp funded program. The complaint is ofp website sometimes bugged. I faced that buggs. Also I reported ofp supporting side and supporting side fixed that issues.

Have a great future ofp traders.",

"I initially had a hard time setting up the platform but the OFP Support Team assisted me throughout the entire process. I needed a web browser version vs the usual MAC download.

"I bought a 100k account at 40% payout and I generated 12k in the account so they had to pay me 5k and they put stupid rules on me at the last minute and stole my account completely. You should not trust them, it is a scam disguised as a funding account.",

"Friends, pls pay attention.. I am CFA charterholder and want to share my experience and truth. First I shouldnt have opened this account because I am a long term investor. But to save fellow innocent traders writing this. This company and their entire leadership is scammers. Please don‚Äôt risk your hard earned money to let it get stolen from this cheaters. Ruggero Catalano Rossi Danielli, Marcello Chiesa and David Bernardi these scammers can manipulate any genuine trade into violation and their support will walk away with non-sense arguments to make u feel u r at fault. Once intentionally tagged as Violation, they will not refund your money and suspend the account.

I have opened a new account by paying USD 876 for 50K 80% payout plan with OFPFunding.com on 15th Jan 2024. On 16th Jan 2024, I have placed orders to trade on their platform. As per their rules the trades will be placed on Demo platform and their risk management team will place it on real market exchange. Unable to attach the screenshots from Metatrader and trade details in excel here. Since all my trade resulted in profit of USD 4575 within few minutes due to extreme volatility in market and their risk team could not place orders in market, so my profit was their loss. I executed WTI futures purchase and placed the sell limit which got executed within minutes because there was some news flashed about US strikes. Later I short sold Crude and again within minutes I made profit. All these trades were legitimate. Moreover my account balance didnt fall below 5% drawdown at any point. Unable to attach the trade screenshot and calculation here on this board. However OFPFunding has manipulated and tagged my genuine trade as violation. Moreover in less than 24 hours they refuse to refund my USD 876 and profit. They stole it and suspended my account.

I have filed a legal case against OFP at DMCC legal clinic and its owners. Its likely OFP will respond to this review below citing their rules.. but friends pls dont trust them.. its all in their favor and they can do whatever they want and can easily manipulate to turn it look like you didnt pay attention. I have given my calculation so clearly and they dont want to go by that. Moreover dont go by positive reviews.. may be few exceptional case will not override the cheating mindset of this scam company. Anything can be purchased in this world even the news.
Save yourself so that you wont be writing this kind of review in future.",

"To all interested traders,

If you are still looking for a good prop firm to join, come and try OFP Funding. When I saw the firm, I signed up and started trading without learning the rules, and having a plan in place to deal with market volatility. As a result, I blew the first 3 accounts.

I took some time off to learn about what I was doing wrong and developed a plan on how to stay alive in this trading game. I learnt all the rules, restrictions, and Q&A's from the website and Youtube channel. Understanding risk management and how to manage it for my account size was key to my trading. Without this knowledge, I will not succeed. Later in the game, I have come to realize that -- this is not gambling. It takes discipline, plan, skills, execution, and determination to make it in this business.

Today, I have reached my first target (Payout Day). It's being reviewed as I'm writing this. I hope everything will be fine. I'm looking forward to my email tomorrow about the result of the review. My share on this is an 80/20 split. I'm glad I picked this option.

I will keep you posted as I have gathered more information.

UPDATE: As it turned out, I don't get the payout. OFP said I violated martingale rule 3 times. So, my account is terminated, and the profit is down the hole. To new traders, learn the rules first before jumping in with OFP.

Best wishes to all. Happy Trading.

Cheers!",

"OFP funding is scam company
My advice is not to open an account in this company because they are a scam. They do not tell you anything until you reach the withdrawal stage and then they say that you have broken the rules. This money was used in a real account. It is better than putting it in this fake company. Please stay away from them.
From OFP company",

"Most stupid rule ever created with the TVR designed to 1) discourage adding on profitable days
2) to make withdrawal profit amount ridiculous based on highest day profit and hence more and more unattainable.

Even when I was in profit I had to lock in early and closed them out knowing a very good day will cause more troubles ahead.

Not recommending or using them anymore.",

"Las reglas son claras y me tome el tiempo de preguntar a detalle a soporte y me las supieron decir a detalle cosa que aprecio mucho, excelente soporte por cierto. Mis ganancias fueron pagadas, ahora si me tomo el atrevimiento de decir que es una excelente empresa.",

"I need technical support but there is no way to access it other than a email. The web site is unclear about how to set This is not right.",

"the worst experience ever!

i have bought an account and i have been trading for 3 months and i didn't receive any payout because of their TVR should be 25% So i have worked all this time to achieve that rule.

i reached it last 2 weeks and sent the support and told me okay iam eligible to the payout at 4 Jan and from this time i didn't do any trade .. and i woke up today and surprised that they closed my account because i use martingale which is i opened on 7 Dec buy position on EURUSD with 0.2 and after an hour opened another one with 0.3 there are only on and the rest of the trades on account is perfect.

they told me on 7 Dec that i can't use this but they should count this from next day.

so Although i reached all the rules and TVR and i waited net profit with 2080$ .. they closed my account.

i asked so many time that anyone can call me but worst support as well.

RUN.. RUN.. RUN.. it's a big scam especially that i know that well as a forex trainer at famous brokers and iam a certified person from IFTA

"I got an email yesterday from OFP. Today was supposed to be my payout day. I have made $2,528 net profit on my $100,000 account. With an 80% sharing ratio, I was expecting a profit share of $2022 as my share in my account today, Meanwhile OFP sent an email that they detected a breach on my account. I did not breach any hard rule. On the 1st of December I placed an initial trade on gbpusd with a lot size of 0.52 risking only 1% of my capital. On the 4th of that same month I hedged the trade, that same day my tutor who introduced me to OFP called to informed me that the company does not allow hedging. so I closed all my position. I don't use martingale system, I use 0.01 lot as my initial position to measure my risk before placing the main trade. I delete the 0.01 lot after I place the main trade. so the only soft rule I breached was that of the hedged position on the 4th of December. I pleaded with OFP to give me a second chance since this was my first warning, they told me i should wait for 28days before they review my account. when i insisted that this was not fair they sent me another message that, due to multiple violation that I am not eligible for a second chance and that my account cannot be recovered. Please avoid this company for they don't have traders interest at heart. it's as if they set you up for failure. Let's inform all other traders to avoid this criminal organization. I hope the appropriate regulatory bodies will hold this company accountable for their scam operations.",

"What I have realised is that the Overview Funding Program is a very strict firm, in terms of options, etc.

Their FAQ is a snapshot of the general terms & conditions. Please go through them and if you want to have a broader idea, look at their T&Cs before deciding to sign up or not.

I like OFP practice, being strict and they only attract genuine traders by that, not those using automated EAs or other tools/practices. The trade has to be yours, your analysis. I'm happy, overall.

Their customer support is exceptional, I must say.

"Excellent experience from ofp give chance to make money",

"It was easy for the purchase to go through, Customer service was also great.",

"I thought i found the best instant funding program but i was disappointed. First, you have to be careful with that TVR rule, otherwise you will be kept delaying payout.
But what hurts me is that people losing accounts because of some rule i've never seen anywhere. I lost my account because i had a sell on US100 and a buy on US30, just because of this i lost account/money. I will never touch this company again, nor advise anyone to go there.

I had them on my affiliate list and website, i will remove it all.

If you have for example USDJPY buy, you can't sell any XXXUSD... What kind of rule is that?",

"IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO WITHDRAW THE PROFITS.

The profits you make on your best day during the entire trading month cannot be more than 25% of your total withdrawal. In other words, you can practically never lose if you want to withdraw your profits.

Example: If you have a good trading day like TP 1:4 and not lose. You have to multiply x4 the profits you obtained that day and additionally you must not lose in the following days so that your balance does not obviously go down and so you can withdraw.

LOSSES ARE AN INSEPARABLE PART OF THIS BUSINESS.

If you are a consistent trader, it is better that you pass a normal challenge, because if you have a good day of profits you can withdraw it and additionally they will give you a refund for the challenge. Here, if you have a very good day of trading, you must repeat it 4 times and you cannot afford to lose any day so that you can withdraw. HAS NO SENSE. Read it twice if you don't understand.
--------------------------------------------

ES CASI IMPOSIBLE RETIRAR LAS GANANCIAS.

Las ganancias que hagas en tu mejor dia durante todo el mes de operativa no puede ser mayor al 25% de tu retiro total. O sea que no puedes perder practicamente nunca si es que quieres retirar las ganancias. si tienes un buen dia de trading TP 1:4 tienes que multiplicar por 4 las ganancias que obtuviste ese dia y adicionalmente no debes perder en los siguientes dias para que obviamente no baje tu balance y asi puedas retirar.

LAS PERDIDAS SON UNA PARTE INSEPARABLE DE ESTE NEGOCIO.


Si eres un trader consistente es mejor que pases un challenge normal, porque si tienes un buen dia de ganancias podras retirarlo y adicional te dan el reembolso del challenge. Aqui si tienes un muy buen dia de trading debes repetirlo 4 veces y no te puedes dar el lujos de perder ningun dia para que asi puedas retirar. NO TIENE SENTIDO. Leelo 2 veces sino entendiste.",

"The Support, Training Help, An Payout Soon",

"I purchased a $100,000 account with 80% profit split costing $1675 last month. Before I made payment, my research about this company. I knew they have soft rule which where the various style of trading they disapprove, but this does not lead to suspension. I used pending hedge to reduce my risk ONLY for this company to suspend my account for hedging. I did not break the hard rules like 5%DD and 10% maxDD. Please avoid this company as their rules are deceptive and designed to fail traders. I was not given a first warning. They are heartless. It was so difficult raising that money, now these criminals have stolen it,


I want to thank OFP for giving me another chance, please, problem has been settled BUT they have repeated the same scam with someone i introduced who made profit on his account the first month. He did not violate ANY rules this people are THIEVES!",

"Rese√±a:

Mi experiencia con OFP ha sido extremadamente desagradable y decepcionante. La falta de transparencia en la aplicaci√≥n de sus reglas, espec√≠ficamente en relaci√≥n con la estrategia de Martingala, es simplemente inaceptable. En lugar de abordar las diferencias fundamentales entre la Martingala y el DCA, OFP opta por asimilarlas de manera irresponsable, lo que demuestra una ignorancia flagrante sobre las estrategias de trading.

Lo m√°s frustrante es que ni siquiera brindan una advertencia o clarificaci√≥n antes de cerrar la cuenta, alegando una supuesta violaci√≥n de sus reglas. Esta falta de comunicaci√≥n y la decisi√≥n abrupta de cerrar la cuenta demuestran una completa falta de consideraci√≥n hacia sus usuarios.

La Martingala y el DCA son conceptos distintos, y la incapacidad de OFP para reconocer estas diferencias es desconcertante y perjudicial para los traders. La confianza en esta plataforma se ve gravemente afectada cuando los usuarios son castigados sin previo aviso ni oportunidad de rectificaci√≥n.

La experiencia con OFP ha dejado un sabor amargo y una sensaci√≥n de injusticia. No puedo recomendar esta plataforma a otros inversores, ya que la falta de transparencia y la aplicaci√≥n arbitraria de reglas son se√±ales de alerta que nadie deber√≠a pasar por alto al considerar una plataforma de trading. En lugar de facilitar un entorno justo y transparente, OFP ha demostrado ser una fuente de frustraci√≥n y decepci√≥n.

"excellent just now joined, i am going get good experience from OFP",

"They are legit and they pay out. The Rules are pretty simple to understand but really hard to achieve. I‚Äôm a swing trader and when I make like 5-10% I have to make 20-40% until I get a payout for the Consistency Score. It‚Äôs a little bit hard to achieve that goal in like 1 month. I haven‚Äôt had a payout since this new rule but I‚Äôm working on it. In the past I had like every month a nice payout. But all in all it‚Äôs a great prop firm.",

"Regrettably, my encounter with this prop firm's drawdown rule has cast a shadow over what could have been a positive trading experience. In my honest opinion, these stringent regulations overshadow, if not entirely eclipse, the merits of the rulebook.

While rules are necessary for order, the trailing drawdown policy feels like a heavy-handed commander, suppressing the very essence of trading freedom. It's disheartening to witness a set of rules that, in my view, prioritize discipline to the detriment of recognizing and celebrating genuine trading success.
Picture this: riding high on profits, only to be yanked back by a rulebook that seems more interested in discipline and seamlessly capitalizing on the trader‚Äôs failure to observe obsolete rigid rules than in celebrating genuine success. This isn't just a limitation; it's a straitjacket on the art of trading. When you close the account because the trader broke this non-trader-friendly rule literally means that you closed the account because he/she was in profit. This is how obsolete and nonsense, in my opinion, this rule really is next to real genuine profits. Full stop.

Moreover, these restrictions loom large, obscuring the positive aspects outlined in the rulebook. It's akin to having a dazzling garden overshadowed by an imposing structure. I believe that a more balanced approach like a static not only as max but also for the daily drawdown from the initial balance‚Äîone that encourages real profits while maintaining discipline‚Äîwould truly elevate the trading experience for all involved.

To the company, consider this not just as feedback but as a call for recalibration. Reevaluate the drawdown policy, and let the positive aspects of your rulebook shine without being eclipsed by overly stringent restrictions. The trading world is dynamic; let the rules reflect and enhance, not stifle, its vibrancy.",

I purchased a $25,000 trading account on 17 October 2023 which I traded carefully and diligently over the last 4 weeks. I did not breach any of the trading rules (or so I thought) over the 4 week period. Every day I checked the trader dashboard to make sure the account was well within limits of the daily draw-down limit.
There is a countdown timer, that counts down the days to the next payout. This is something that any trader would look forward to and systematically trade every day to work towards this payout goal.

Last night the countdown timer had 1 day to go to payout. I was confident that no rules had been breached, as the smart dashboard metrix would have and should have notified me. I closed all the positions on the account and had a decent profit to be withdrawn today.

Instead, I woke up to an email from OFP support with the heading account violation and that the account is suspended!

The reason is Hedging. You are not allowed to have a buy and sell position regardless of lot size on the same trading instrument at any time.
accompanied by a screenshot of this "prohibited offense" happening on 17 OCTOBER !!

So on Day 1 of trading a ridiculous rule of no hedging positions is violated and I get told nothing about it. I am left to continue trading for 27 more days, only to get told about this on the day of the supposed payout.

This is UNACCEPTABLE!

Hedging in itself is a risk management tool available on ALL MT4/5 accounts and if used correctly; as for example before a news event to have zero exposure until after the news settles, is a very useful tool in any trader's toolbox.

I am writing this review to save potential clients valuable time and money and not to waste a whole month of diligently trading an account for nothing!

Support response after explaining my issue of why only informing after 28 days instead of day 1 is generic and unsympathetic.

It seems OFP will use any excuse not to pay out their clients.",

"Best support team with best support manager Raudel. Each time he delivers helps on best time .. best of all...",

"Great experience. I was initially hesitant but found the rules for a payout to be clear and, more importantly, well aligned with my personal trading strategy. I already received my first payout which was very smooth and I am looking forward to the next!",

"Mi hanno bloccato un account da 100000$ perch√® avrei usato la strategia martingala su alcuni trade di oltre due settimane fa, cosa che non intendevo assolutamente fare e che non rientra nel mio stile. In risposta alla mia richiesta di potrer proseguire a tradare con quell'account, come avevo fatto fino ad oggi, mi hanno elencato le strategie che non ammettono, (che sono tante), aggiungendo che non ammettono vari stili di trading sospetti, (quindi, cos√¨ facendo, possono contestare tutto e trovare tutte le cuse possibili per non pagare i profitti ai traders!). State lontani!!!
They blocked my $100,000 account because I allegedly used the martingale strategy on some trades from over two weeks ago, which I absolutely did not intend to do and which is not my style. In response to my request to be able to continue trading with that account, as I had done until today, they listed the strategies they do not allow, (which are many), adding that they do not allow various suspicious trading styles, (therefore, by doing so, they can dispute everything and find all possible reasons not to pay profits to traders!). Stay away!!!",

"After more than one month of emails between me, my partner and OFP, they still refused to give the payout even though we gave them a clear explanation and there was clearly no rule violation. My partner gave them a bad review, then they attempted to bribe her to change it. Additionally, they lied in their reply about the violation that happened. All in all this company is corrupt and I highly suggest you don't work with them.",

"So far good
No Problem",

"The purchase was swift and in less than 24 hours I had my log in credentials. Very good response time. I hope it‚Äôs same speed even payouts.",

"After I informed the support they fixed the problem and sent me the Credentials of the new account
Thank you, OFP, you are truly a serious company",

"Dopo quasi 1 anno devo dire che hanno migliorato le situazioni che c'erano prima, le 2 regole insignificanti, 3 day a week e 2 min, regole assolutamente inopportune per chi fa trading, togliendole, direi che hanno esponenzialmente aumentato fiducia e capito il trader, perch√® alla fine chi √® un trader vincente, lo sar√† nel lungo periodo, non servono barriere c'√® gia il mercato, chi √® perdente sar√† perdente anche senza regole, anzi per la fretta di fare soldi brucier√† il conto in 1 giorno.",

"Hola, hoy quiero darle tranquilidad a personas que est√©n pensando comprar alguna cuenta con OFP y decirles que est√©n tranquilos, hace unos d√≠as compre mi cuenta, y por alg√∫n motivo el pago no se vio reflejado por lo que no me dieron las credenciales, sin embargo el equipo de soporte estuvo activo todo el tiempo, respondiendo mis mensajes y d√°ndome tranquilidad, finalmente me dieron mis credenciales, y puedo dar FE que su dinero no se va a perder nunca al momento de comprar con esta empresa.",

"OPF claims to give 3 simple rules to trade and that "you are allowed to use any genuine strategy you want".
However, the "genuine trading behaviors" clause leaves you disadvantaged as it is subject to their interpretation.",

"I registered a 25K - 80% account with an amount of $443, however after paying with OFP through the Trustpayment portal, my money was deducted from my account but OFP did not send any account information.
24 hours later I received my account, a bit slow but acceptable, will rate 5* if the service is good later!",

"Le diera 5 estrellas si permitieran herramientas de gestion de Riesgo como easyorder entre otras mas, esto pienso que seria la cereza que le hace falta al pastel para considerar esta como una de las mejores empresas de fondeo instantanea.",

"My experience with the OFP direct financing company was wonderful and exceptional in an indescribable way. I advise everyone to buy accounts funded by this legendary company. I hope to see more progress, development and facilities for traders in this company.",

"Great customer support
I had a problem not be able to accessing my account, and they fixed it quickly",

"Me dieron las credenciales a la hora que hice el pago y la verdad todo super, con mucho entusiasmo por empezar a sacar beneficios ! Tengo amigos que ya est√°n retirando dinero sin problema",

"Le doy 5 estrellas a ofp gracias a su nueva actualizaci√≥n de sistemas donde eliminan los 3 dias de financiaci√≥n..",

"Dear friends, I would like to share with you my sincere experience made with OFP Funding since August 2023. The account opening process went quite well and quickly. However, this was the only perfect process. In other words, cashing-in at OFP works well and that‚Äôs it. After I paid the amount, I would be better off now, if I had forgotten everything and the OFP, rather than losing a lot of my worthy time and nerves.Instead of an IC-Markets account, they opened a Blueberry account. I did not care first, as the instruments were the same. Having started with trading, I realized, that the trading froze from time to time and did not let me trade properly. These MT5-account freezes lasted sometimes for 2-3 days. During this time I did not have any control of my open positions. When I wrote to the Support Team, they answered only, they were aware about this issue.Some weeks later,same issues. Again, their answer was, that they were sorry and would look for a solution. Having traded normally for some days, the account freeze came again. After a new complaint, they changed my account from Blueberry to ICMarkets. Unfortunately, these trade freezes occurred on ICMarkets as well.The dashboard never worked properly, never showed where I was about. All indicators were wrong and nothing had any relation to my account. I had to verify my account more than 14 times and the verification button appeared again. When new account rules were introduced, I was flagged with the old 2-minutes rule. The support team told me, that I should ignore these and follow the new rules. Some days later, my account was set inactive because of violation. After my complaint, they set it active again. As I am a very patient person, I always thought, these guys at OFP were good people, who are on one hand technically centuries behind the prop firm industry, on the other hand as they are always friendly‚Ä¶.I should give them the time and chance to improve them. Even though, they made me lose my profit from 600 Pounds to 112 Pounds last month, because of trade freezes. And from these 112 Pounds they cut and cut my profits and paid me 16.75 Pounds only, because of excuses nowhere written on their webpage. OK, not really satisfied, however, with a new attitude this month I followed all their rules and reached almost 528 Pounds profit. And this morning I got the email, that my account was suspended because of violation. The reason was apparently ‚ÄúMartingale‚Äù. I traded very small lots and always all the risk management in my mind, they suddenly came up with Martingale rule. This was not a problem last month and even this month I had other instruments, which could be in their eyes also Martingale. But they did not flag them as Martingale. They took arbitrarily one Index pair and punished me with Martingale. Their promotion was always the same, only three rules: daily drawdown, total drawdown and Value Rule. Friends, stay away from this scam company. My mistake was, not reading the negative assessments on Trustpilot beforehand. As problems occurred one by one, I started reading the red-star Trustpilot comments and realized, that those people were all right. Everything they mentioned was true. This OFP is fooling me around endlessly. Always one step ahead and then 2 steps back. As the signs of fraudulence started very quickly to appear, luckily I could stop myself from buying more accounts. When they changed their website and introduced new programs and rules, I was suspicious, if this a new fraud action of this company in order to trap more victims. When I received an email with the promotion of the new programs with 80% profit share, I asked them, that I was looking for good reasons to buy a new account, as my current account did not work, neither dashboard nor the MT5 account. Thanks God again, I did not fall into their new trap and did not buy an 80% account. Friends, we are all humans and if we are once focused on buying something, then we have only the positive things in our minds and all the negative things we hide mentally or we do not want to see. However, if there are negative comments on anything, these are actually the points we should question and think and think again, why all those people have taken so much time and written these comments on Trustpilot. It is very easy to collect 5-stars with trivial comments.The more important thing is, how they work in practice, how they solve problems, how they pay people‚Ä¶all these things are written in the negative comments only (unfortunately).The worst thing is, that there is no regulation authority, who takes any legal action against such fraudulent companies like OFP Funding.They are making business with the principle ‚ÄúThe world is big enough for finding people to trap‚Äù. That‚Äôs their business model.",

"Company reserves the right to deny payout to clients because they do not have objective guidelines as to what is considered "inconsistent behaviour", meaning they do not give a decent explanation for why payout is denied and are not receptive of clients explaining their strategies in detail. After 3 years of trading professionally with the same consistent strategy, this is the first company to deny payout due to "gambling behaviour" although said company do not have sufficient evidence to prove their case and are not receptive of another point of view. Do not recommend as I have lost a lot of money buying accounts and not getting paid profits earned through legit strategy.

EDIT: Would like to add that after the publication of this review, the company OFP tried to bribe me into changing my review by offering me a free account *only* in exchange for a better review. In addition, the response given by said company below this review offers false information which does not by any means represent the strategy and rules I have been applying for 3+ years. An average lot size of 10 and a jump to 0.01 lot size positions is an absurd strategy, if any, and has not been applied by me nor will it ever be by any sane trader. This false accusation and the bribe from the company in question only justifies my original statement and should be recorded for the purpose of warning other traders from having to go through the same experience with said company.",

"Knew OFP about half a year ago. Really appreciating the way they've changed themselves to be competitive in the prop firm market.

2 good things they've just made: better payout up to 80% for instant program, and better scaling program.

But the best thing is their prices. They have the most competitive pricing for instant program in the market.

There are many things still not looking attractive to traders though: no EA and no copy trade from external accounts.
Without them, traders will be reluctant to add OFP to their prop firm lists.
Myself for example, I've already had account in other prop firms, then why would I add OFP since there is no way I can manage OFP and my current accounts at the same time.
Their business is built on demo account and risk team model, which means no live trade from traders. Then no EA and no external copy trading are unnecessary from my perspective.",

"I purchased an account for almost $500 USD . I placed some trades and made profit. But I had a trade that was closed because it hit take profit and for some reason it did it fast because the market started moving and it moved within 2 minutes of me setting the trade up. And so I was penalized because the market decided to move fast and close my trade hitting my take profit. So the same day I paid that they closed my account because the market moved fast and closed me out within 2 minutes. This is unfair because we don't have control over how fast a market moves. So pretty much a lost about $500 in one day's time because of something out of my control. I think this needs to be revisited and redesign if you want to keep an honest and reputable prop firm",

"Servicio y atenci√≥n excelente. Procesos claros y r√°pidos. Extraordinaria plataforma y funcionalidad.",

"honest review for OPF, I have working with them since January, and I got 3 payouts and received every payout in less than 12 hours, 4th one is coming in a few days InshaAllah, best instant program for me because of the cheap prices and the high drawdown limits, 5% DD and 10% Max DD which is very high for me if we compare to other instant programs, Quick Support and Overall experience is really good with OFP.",

"1. I refer to OFP Team‚Äôs reply on Trustpilot on 29th Aug 2023.

2. The reply of OFP Team was very disappointing as everyone can see that they just replied points that were advantageous to them and ignored the rest.
OFP Team were unable to answer :
Since is 1 payout, then why my dashboard was indicated account type is 80% Monthly?

3. I said I have paid an expensive lesson of 2000USD, I did not said I had purchased 2000USD on 80% model, factually, I paid ¬£1493 for 100k which is equivalent to 2000USD and compare of purchasing 40% lifelong 100k account, I had paid double price on it BUT benefits are the WORSE. Beside 1 payout, I am not even allowed to make a mistake to close a trade under 2 minutes which lifelong account is permitted regardless the previous payout is negative or positive profit. Therefore, OFP Team replied ‚Äú‚Ä¶The trading rules were the same as all the other accounts‚Ä¶‚Äù was a lie.

4. When I requested to pay by credit card, I was told by Live Chat staff that 80% model was exceptional case on compulsory pay by crypto,therefore, I have to spend more service charge to buy crypto for payment.

5. According to the Live Chat staff, I was told 80% model is a promotion so there is no 10% referral fee awarded to the person who referred me by using his affiliation link.

6. Up till now, I never receive an official notification from OFP saying that I violated their rule and hence, my account has been terminated. My account simply became ‚ÄúInactive‚Äù.
As the MT4 still trade as normal we can see that this is obviously OFP trying to continue copy trade without giving any payout if I don‚Äôt discover it.

7. For lifelong account, OFP allow trader to make mistake for one or two trades martingale strategy, but 80% model is not allow, this sentence was confirmed by the manager by the name of Raudel, therefore, I am confused which rule have I violated and get terminated?
Is 2 minutes rule or Martingale rule or both?

8. For everyone‚Äôs info: my previous payout is negative profit of 0.9%, currently my account is in positive profit. Therefore, it is ridiculous that OFP terminated my account quietly just because I had made a mistake of 2 minutes rule or a mistake of martingale trade which both violations are acceptable without termination on all lifelong account, moreover I had paid double price on it and never receive any payout.

9. I do understand if I am a risky trader, I might cause a big loss to OFP. However, what kind of losses will OFP suffered if I have accidentally close a trade under 2 minutes with a profit or a martingale strategy with a profit?
Answer:
A) OFP has gain the profit of copy trade even if I closed it more than 1 minute but less than 2 minutes as 2 minutes rule was a new rule just implemented recently.
B) OFP has found a good opportunity to forfeit ¬£1493 on my registration
C) OFP has gain all copy trade of all my past trading profit with zero payout to me.

10. OFP staff unable to show any video explanation to proof of the exceptional rules on 80% model, but they keep advice me to read over those hidden rules on their website that has been removed when the 80% model promo expired on 17th July 2023. Hence, it is totally unfair to terminate my account quietly when the T & C on 80% model was removed on OFP website.

11. OFP T & C did not state that they can set our account to ‚ÄúInactive‚Äù quietly without email to inform us. Kindly show your proof of sending out email to me over here to prove that I am lying.",

"At first everything was fine. I received my first payout without any problems. After the second month they didn't pay me on my payout date and didn't tell me why I wasn't receiving a payout. They requested a video explaining my strategy. No other prop firm does this. They owe me $2000.

Edit: Today 11/10/2023 I received an email from trustpilot saying OFP funding has flagged my review. This is the second time they tried to take down my review. This company is dishonest. The fact is I made a profit and didn't break any rules and didn't receive a payout. And when I asked why I didn't receive a payout and what rules I may have broken, they wouldn't answer.",

the reason is I didn't hold my positions as long as usual last week

"I tried to contact the support to upgrade my account because my DD exceded the limit for the 50k
Right now I'm up 8k, but I'll never see this money so don't buy it's only a waste of time.
I suggest OFP to stop the account directly from meta, and not send just an email (that go in the spam)",

"Scam
Scammers looking for a trivial reason to pay
Today I lost my account after I made 8% profits in it over the past month, but they did not pay me on the payment date, and they said that the account is reviewed for a period of 15 trading days and because of this long period I lost the account because I was very frustrated for a whole month of fatigue and burning nerves, then after achieving profits they do not pay For you, I will not buy an account with you anymore. I will go to other financing companies that give a challenge. As you know, the companies have become open for the period of time, and there you will not face the issue of forcing you to trade 3 days in a week, the issue of the size of contracts and a lot of stupid rules found here.",

"Quiero decir que no recomiendo esta empresa, En mi caso particular tuve muy malas experiencias con ella. Siento que me Robaron mi dinero. lean mi experiencia y saquen ustedes sus propias conclusiones.
1-Tienen una regla de 2 minutos, que no te permite equivocarte porque pierdes tu cuenta. En mi caso particular perd√≠, 2 cuentas por esta regla. Pero lo que M√°s me molesta es quela segunda vez me dejaron tener profitt, para el d√≠a de hacer retiro decirme que d√≠as atr√°s cerr√© 2 operaciones antes de los dos minutos. Me pregunto por qu√© no avisaron en el momento, porque lo hicieron cuando estaba en profitt? Se quedaron con el dinero de la compra y con el profitt
2-Son mentirosos, su programa de referido es una estafa, toman el cliente tra√≠do a la empresa por ti y luego te inventan algo para no darte el beneficio o pago por traer al cliente, yo refer√≠ a mi esposa, compramos una cuenta del 10 mil con el programa del 80% que incluso es m√°s cara que el resto de los programas,40% o 26%, de veneficio, y resulto que el referido solo aplica para los programas menores, el programa de 80% era una promoci√≥n. Correcto me pregunto, donde estaba escrito que los referidos solo val√≠an para programas menores? Si una persona trae un referido a la compa√±√≠a, este compra el que m√°s le convenga, si no cuenta alg√∫n programa, lo l√≥gico es que lo digan, que este escrito en alguna parte, porque la compa√±√≠a gano conmigo y yo le traje un referido gratis. Son unos mentirosos
3- Porque siento que es estafa esta empresa?
Bueno, mi esposa opero durante un mes, y resulto que tuvo que avisarles que tocaba pago, ya que estaba en profitt, ya que pasado los 29 d√≠as no hab√≠a recibido el correo de pago. Cuando le escribi√≥, primero dijeron que ellos avisaban por correo, pero a insistencia de mi esposa revisaron y pasaron varias horas para responder que la cuenta ser√≠a suspendida porque se detect√≥ 2 violaciones, se realiz√≥ martingala y cobertura cosa prohibida por la empresa, se√±ores nunca hubo ninguna martingala, martingala en pocas palabras es un sistema de apuestas progresivo en el cual doblar√°s tu apuesta tras una p√©rdida, nunca hubo una perdida ni mucho menos se dobl√≥ o triplico la posici√≥n, simplemente mi esposa fue entrando al mercado medido en el rango que era favorable, que ella cre√≠a que el precio llegar√≠a, sin cerrar ninguna posici√≥n y con un mismo potaje, nada que ver con martingala, martingala dice que pierdes y doblas, triplicas y as√≠ mientras pierdes, aqu√≠ no fue as√≠ se entr√≥ con 0.15 a medida que el precio entraba en el rango que ten√≠amos previsto. a y esto ocurri√≥ una semana antes del cobro, en fin se quedaron con el costo de la cuenta y el profitt
4- dijeron que hizo operaci√≥n de cobertura, no s√© qui√©n analiza los trades , pero saben lo que es decir
que se ejecut√≥ una operaci√≥n de cobertura teniendo 2 trade en marcha y una estando a su favor 3a1, simplemente iba a cerrar una de las posiciones y por error se activ√≥ una orden y por su regla de los dos minutos no se pudo cerrar antes y de cerro a los 3.
En fin, consider√≥ que la empresa no es transparente, que va a buscar la forma de no pagarte, No son legales act√∫an de mala fe.",

"First of all, you must be a profitable trader to be on here. I see a few people are putting bad reviews just because they blew up their account and didn't read and follow the rule. This is what makes us traders disciplined. I love OFP and wish them to be around many years from now and grow together as myself a trader. This is an honest review and I don't write reviews unless I go through it. Thank you OFP and happy trading !!!",

"Very nice experience with ofp i have just started trading with ofp.",

"i working 3 months with OFP..rules r totally waste..Traders not using same lot size on all orders..
gold is most volatile pair..so traders using low lot size..
we change the lot size depends on risk reward ratio..(if risk is low we use higher lot size)..

Rules r really worst.. Don't waste your time and money..
There r many instant funding prop firms with weekly payout and without rules..

Good byee...OFP..
(Sorry for my english)..",

"WHAT A SCAM! WOLD RATE 0 IF I COULD!

Is this a prop firm? Read carefully and you guys decide. I am just sharing what I experienced. It doesn't benefits me, and most of you guys see a 4-5 stars reviews because ofp has this fidelity program, which gives points to people so they get discount from their purchase, I won't say they are fake, but most may be untrue.

Ofp pays only every 28 days, and when it approaches the 28th days, they send me a "deferred payout" for another 28 days to request a payout. The reason was stated that I did not close the trade, so they automatically defer my payout, and I have to "no choice" continue to trade for another 28 days. Why didn't notify me? At least send an email letting the traders know.

The dashboard also got problem, regarding to the 28days payout, the dashboard shows a 2 days delayed time to 10 August payout date, where originally supposed to be 8 August, this made me think that I had 2 more days to trade before reach payout day. Then after me sending email to them, they say it my fault that I did not count 28 days from the account credentials being send.

Moreover, when you reach to their support, sometime you can feel the unwillingness to provide you the support. You can try, if you don't believe.

One of the most annoying thing that their service is that there is no warning or notification at all! There is this really stupid rule called "2 minutes rule", where traders are not suppose to open and close a trade within 2 min. The room for mistake is only 1 time. What do you guys think? Reasonable? What if the market is going volatile or what if you accidentally enter a wrong trade (clicked the wrong button, instead of buy you accidentally click on sell), does that mean you have to wait til 2 minutes and wait for either losses or profit (good case) then you can close? Surely OFP does not want to you earn, they just want to you pay for their account. So what I want to share is that they only notify you when you violated, which means, when you made the first mistake they won't warn you first, they wait quietly and once they spot that you did the second violation, they say send an email say they are sorry, that I have violated, you cannot do anything but accept the fact, because it it their rule. However, when you purchase or you reach to their website, you cannot find the clauses or rules (probably not easily to find), they just state that, the three rules are daily, max drawdown and trade 3 days per week.

Tons of complain to be made, another one is that when they reply your email regarding to violation, they reply almost immediately, but when you ask about your payout, their reply take forever. Is it they try to drag their payout, or ....? You guys decide.

One of my friends has also joined OFP, they OFP sent payout email to him, then they deducted part of his profit, stating that he has made "martingale trades" on his account, which is also part of the "hidden rule" when you ask on discount, then they will show you the screenshot. In this case, they keep your deducted profit, and then you only take the rest. However, it was not martingale after checking with discord members. After that, they said payout will be process within 24-48hours (fair enough, though is slightly slow), then 48 hours later, no actions have been made from them, asking what expectations should I have, and no reply was given, no email received regarding to payout has been process nor profit deducted from my trading account.

After having said everything that I experience, I concluded that they may just want you to purchase and not paying your profit. Therefore, if you guys want to registered and purchase with this firm, PLEASE THINK TWICE!!! I cannot even withdraw the profit I made because of the stupid "hidden rule" of "2 minutes rule"",

"Honestly you are not a real profirm. A real profirm will want traders to profit from their capital, a real profirm will have resources and support available to traders who already join your program.
Let's see what we have with OFP ?
A dashboard and website is so bad that it's hard to know if an account is active or not.
A very long set of implicit rules in clause 5.4 that can lead to account termination but is not mentioned on their website or social platforms, which shows their ambiguity. Rules that lead to account breaches should be put in a place where everyone can see them and on their platforms there should be posts to warn traders but they don't.
Speaking of Raudel, you need to know that he locked my main discord account while I was explaining it to him but I haven't given any false information in the general chat, which annoys me and I just created many other discords to talk to him. So if he believes I'm wrong,why not let me publicize the information in the chat group so that the community can decide if I deserve to have my account terminated or not?
Over the past year or so I've seen a lot of things newbies don't see about locking the accounts of traders with big profits and then paying normal payout to regain the community's trust. This has happened many times but after each such time people's trust in your company will decrease and in due time you will scam like your old project.
For those who don't know, Ofp's predecessor is Overviewfx which is a company that provides courses and signals, before that they did not have the experience and financial capacity to operate a real profirm. Find a way to eliminate the traders have big profits and pay smaller payouts for trust, everything has been seen by me but the fact that you pay profits in May makes me trust you and can you explain the same Trading strategy in May can withdraw money, but not in July?
I'm not going to stop here but after thinking I don't think it's necessary to bring you down while you are not a real profirm, let the members decide if they should join a ‚Äúprofirm‚Äùwith no trust from the community or not.Ofp will close the project soon and open another one for successful bleaching, goodbye fake profirm.",

"Now OFP have changed 2 minutes rules. cheers OFP. All the best traders...",

"Regrettable experience. It has all the ingredients of a company that bases its profits on people's subscriptions and NEVER on the profit percentage of traders.
First of all they have DEMO accounts, they are never real accounts. Something strange when it is a direct funding in which they are supposed to pay from the first month. The normal thing would be for the accounts to be real and from these accounts to extract the percentage of the profits... but no, they are a DEMO account... suspicious.
Second, its interface and desktop is really bad. It is down every 2-3 days. it does not offer any information or tell you what profit your account or your drawdawn takes or if you have violated any rules. Nothing. it's really embarrassing.
Of course, if you violate any rule, it will not be communicated to you at the moment, as in any normal funding company. In OFP Funding you have to go into discord and ask the admin if you have violated any rules, giving your MT4 account number in front of all the other users. It is a very bad system.
But now comes the best: In my 25k account I made almost 9k profit in 3 weeks. Well, 2 days ago I received an email (after having asked on Discord, obviously if I had violated any rules) that I had 2 TRADES UNDER 2 MINUTES and that I did not collect my benefits or my account was suspended. After having asked on discord if something happened if by mistake he closed a trade before two minutes and his administrator said that NOTHING HAPPENED. It is shameful and unfortunate. And I have all the evidence and captures.
After making a 9k profit, they closed my account for "supposedly" having violated the 2 minute rule in 2 trades. Never again with these companies with hidden and opaque rules. His business is getting money out of people with subscriptions. that's my opinion.",

"Las reglas y el soporte son bastante c√≥modas , considere eso bastante importante ,cualquier duda la responden r√°pido y muy amables ,incluso tienen videos donde explican cada aspecto. Eso me gust√≥ mucho",

"This is my first time buying an account of OFP. With instant funding, OFP has good policies, clear regulations and quick support.
I need more experience in the withdrawal process for a more comprehensive review. However, with initial experience, this is a fund worth your consideration and cooperation.",

"they are good guys, but I wish they can have online chat functionality",

"This program is one of the most amazing programs in the field and you should join and forget about wasting time on verification",

"I'am having a great exp√©rience trading with you. Thanks ans keep it up.",

"I didn‚Äôt receive my account logging information until l today. Purchase day was 07/19 it‚Äôs a week of waiting. No one reach out to explain the reason of delay.",

"very nice experience and the platform is easy to use",

"Buen soporte

El soporte es bueno, responden r√°pido y veo las preguntas de las dem√°s personas ser respondidas de forma clara, concisa, detallada y muy respetuosa. Eso es bastante bueno",

"OFP is a wonderful reality for Traders who want to use their talent to create economic independence, they are very strict with their rules and it is good that way since a Trader goes through the inevitable routine of education and improvement of discipline in this way, I signed up with OFP for a while then I had problems which led me to make mistakes in reading my strategy but they always understood and although they have always been wonderfully strict in making me respect their rules I must say that they are a truly unique reality and a I add that in the phase before my mistakes I also received the payout so everything is perfect always great OFP I hope to return soon to work for them with them and with them",

"Worst firm prop. Dashboard has no functionality for day trading rules. We are forced to calculate by ourselves. Violation warning sent on payment date. Why is it not stated in the dashboard its functionality. Fraud internally",

"Hard Rules but great team",

"OFP has the rule of 5% Drawdown which says:
"5% Daily Drawdown
Your equity and balance must not be less or equal than your daily maximum balance minus the account margin. The account margin is 5% of your initial deposit balance. Each day is considered to be starting from midnight GMT +0. Breaking the rule will lead to the account closure."
According to this rule, the 5% is based on the initial capital and on the Balance at the end of the previous day.
Nothing in the rule says that the 5% is movable during the day.
I bought a small account of $5k on July 15th. I started trading the 17th.
At the end of the day of 17th of July, my balance was $5262.50 which means the violation value is supposed to be $5012.50.
During the 18th, both my equity and balance went up to $5366.60 and by end of day of the 18th it went down to $5021.
OFP considered that I violated the rule of 5% which according to their rule, the breach value is supposed to be $5012.50.
OFP sent me an email on the 21th of July. Hence, I reached out to the support team (same day July 21) and spoke with Raudel to explain my disagreement and they insisted that I violated the rule based on this:
"Your equity and balance must not be less or equal than your daily maximum balance minus the account margin.
Your maximum balance was $5366.6
5366.6-250=5116.6"

So according to OPF, the 5% is movable during the day which is completely the opposite of what is written in the website.

This is very bad experience for me and I discourage anyone to join OFP.",

"hi want to ask what happen if fail or breach account. must start again in new account or get blacklisted? just asking.. i m no start yet",

"They basically want you to trade there strategy. There are so many guidelines.I accidentally clicked 2 buys and canceled one because I didn‚Äôt wanna over leverage and my account was shut down for 2min trade rule",

"I've been trading with OFP for quite some time now, and I must say, it has been an absolutely fantastic experience. The opportunities and resources provided by this prop trading firm are unparalleled, and it's no wonder why they are renowned in the industry. However, I have a suggestion that I believe would further enhance the trading experience for us, the traders.

Firstly, let me highlight the aspects that make OFP stand out from the crowd. Their platform is incredibly user-friendly, offering a wide range of markets to trade and cutting-edge trading tools that help analyze market trends efficiently. Additionally, the support team is second to none, always available to address any queries or concerns promptly. The firm's risk management policies are top-notch, ensuring that traders can engage in trades with confidence.

Now, let's delve into the suggestion that I firmly believe would benefit all traders involved. It would be highly beneficial if OFP considered implementing a restriction on the number of trades traders can open in a single day, excluding any trades carried over from the previous day. Restricting traders to a maximum of 2 to 3 trades per day would be a prudent step towards enhancing the quality of trades and promoting disciplined trading practices.

Here's why this suggestion holds significance:

Improved Trade Focus: Limiting the number of trades per day would compel traders to be more selective with their positions. This would naturally lead to a higher level of focus on each trade, enabling traders to thoroughly analyze opportunities before execution.

Risk Management: By restricting the number of trades, traders would be encouraged to pay closer attention to risk management. Lowering the frequency of trades reduces exposure to market fluctuations and potential losses, ensuring greater control over trading capital.

Emotional Discipline: Trading psychology plays a crucial role in success, and limiting the number of trades can help traders avoid impulsive decisions driven by emotions. A disciplined approach to trading fosters better decision-making and long-term profitability.

Skill Development: Encouraging traders to be more selective with their trades can lead to a greater emphasis on learning and skill development. Traders would be motivated to refine their strategies and continuously improve their trading techniques.

While OFP is already leading the way in providing exceptional trading opportunities, introducing this restriction could be a powerful value addition. Traders would not only benefit from the firm's exceptional platform and support but also enjoy the advantages of structured and disciplined trading practices.

In conclusion, I can confidently say that OFP is an outstanding prop trading firm that has greatly contributed to my success as a trader. The suggestion to limit the number of trades per day is a minor adjustment that has the potential to elevate the trading experience even further. I have no doubt that with such an improvement, OFP would cement its position as the go-to choice for traders seeking an optimal and profitable trading journey.

Kudos to OFP for its continuous commitment to excellence, and I eagerly look forward to witnessing further advancements in the future. Happy trading!",

Esperemos operar bien durante este mes para poder hacer mi retiro.",

"So they got back to me with their "review" ahead of schedule and it was very confusing actually. During the review period, they started copying my trades with .01 lots to check for any major differences in execution. However there really weren't any. Most of them were the same and there was only one execution that had more than a one pip difference (GU). They claimed I abused demo conditions and permanently banned me from their platform. So buyer beware, if you do score a payout > 10%, your account will be subject to bogus reviews.
Full disclosure: I trade SMC with tight 2-3 pip stops so of course ICmarkets demo was a great place for me to trade. If there was a concern with potential slippage, they could instead deduct a percentage of my payout instead. But they won't since it's a scam company.

Edit: In regards to your response, you are confusing me with another Indian trader. Please check your database again. I've posted my full findings along with the spreadsheet they sent me in the Prop Firms telegram group where they advertise.",

"Reglas muy ambiguas, que son adaptadas a conveniencia de la empresa. Mi cuenta fu√© suspendida supuestamente por no cumplir la regla de los 3 d√≠as, lo que es totalmente falso. Solo pude hacer un retiro.
Seguir√© buscando una empresa realmente ser√≠a.",

"I am extremely disappointed with OFP Forex Prop Firm's failure to meet their payout deadlines. Despite promises of 48-72 hours, 10 working days, and 20 working days, my payout remains unresolved. Even after giving them an extra week, they continue to delay without valid reasons or communication and my account is still under review after all those deadlines as they cant even review one account in a month. I caution others to be wary of OFP's unreliability and lack of professionalism.",

"NOT transparency with a lot of hidden rules, try to DEDUCT PROFIT of traders, very unprofessional prop firm.

OFP use WordPress (a free open-source) to build their website which was integrated many third-party plugins, it causes a lot of bugs and dummy texts appear everywhere in their website.

When I do investigate in some trading communities, I found many cases like me. I‚Äôm collecting all feedbacks about OFP and will publish in the next review with screen captures. So again, don‚Äôt trust 5* reviews, they‚Äôre all seeding content.

Below is about the story how OFP stole ~20k $ profit from me:
1st payout: I earned $3,195 and OFP deducted $798.75 because the GAP rule. They sent me 2 pictures of 2 trades which violated.
After that I had a deeply discussion with Support Team to understand how GAP rule work.

2nd payout: I earned $5,632 and OFP again deducted a half of profits because of GAP rule. But they sent me 2 pics of trade which were happened in the 1st previous trading cycle??? When I asked them to send the right proofs, OFP said that they can‚Äôt do this manually because this is an automatic system (how they could do this in the 1st payout????) then a manager said to me these photos was: ‚Äúas examples to give you an idea of the rule‚Äù. Why didn't they focus show the concrete evidence??

I‚Äôm sure that they can‚Äôt because my trade was hit TP at top of the price wave, so there was no GAP happened before at this closed price range.

3rd payout: luckily, I got a quite big profit ($15,414), and finally they refused my payout after a long discussion. This time, they said I violated gambling rule even though I passed all their rules: 2.5 times volume rule, 2-minute rule, 3 trades per week rule, max loss and max daily loss rule and I didn't use HFT method...They turn to mention about average transaction time was too different. But when I ask to show me where I could read about "average transaction time rule" in OFP website, they kept silent about this question???

4th payout: right now, my account still in profit. I'll update later how they will treat me this time.

By my story, you understand that OFP DON'T WANT traders to win. They hold your trades and try to deduct/refuse payout by a lot of hidden rules. That the reason why you can read some recent reviews here which told you that OFP hold their profit for a very long review time. If it's a WIN-WIN relationship, why they run business like this way?

@Trust Pilot: thanks for your very useful platform. In case you need, I‚Äôm very pleased to send you all proofs (email, trade screenshot, other trader's case...) I collected to prove that I'm the real trader and what I reviewed is the FACT.

@OFP: I‚Äôm continue collecting all cases like me from social communities for next review. You absolutely know me so don‚Äôt say that you can‚Äôt find my email in database. Pls play a fair game with traders.

@OFP Trader: if you used to trade with OFP and was stolen profit like me, help me by a like. Many thanks.

@New Traders: read carefully 1* & 2* reviews, you will know the FACT of this prop firm.
-----------------------------------------------
Update 1: Thanks for more than 20 "likes" who support me. We could see I'm not the only one was "stolen profit" by OFP!

Update 2 (for OFP's reply):
Please don't explain in general and get straight to the point for 2nd payout: If you said that I "broke multiple times", so could you kindly show me the proof of trades which broke GAP rule? (Cause you deducted a half of my profit)

And why didn't you mention about the 3rd payout? I had a screenshot which was captured before & after you changed trading rules page without notice anything to traders.

Due to your dishonest behavior which are trying to tell a lie with Trust Pilot aim to hide this review, I will change this rating from 2* to 1* and I will work closely with Trust Pilot to make clear everything.

Update 4: Finally, Trust Pilot label my review as verified while OFP still keep silent about my above questions.
If you are going with OFP, keep in mind that they readily approve small payouts. When your profit comes to larger amounts, they will try many ways to refuse your payout.
I already opened an investigation about their office in London, the result in detail may be published in my next review.",

I learned trading through this firm .
There is only one rule which was not the part of this firm when I started the 2 minute rule with suspension of account .
Kindly OFP plz take this rule back

Just don't suspend the account
Bcz as I purchase this account with loan only 2 mistakes can take my account plz plz take away this rule of suspension .

After recently changes in rules and account types and profit share

This is the best company in prop firm industry
Thanks OFP",

"La empresa es muy buena, yo tenia temor a las pruebas de fondeo, con fondeo directo, ya llevo 4 meses de rentabilidad. Retirando dinero y aportando en mi casa. Mejorando d√≠a a d√≠a para comprar la cuenta de 100k. El √∫nico inconveniente es que deber√≠an de tener mayor capital por persona y no limitar a 100k",

"Thanks OFG for providing me with a new account after the trouble I had. Then I downloaded mt5 at ofpfungding.com and realized that the software failed to open my account. I had to go to blueberrymarkets.com to download mt5 to use it. I hope that OFG will have better adjustments.",

"third consecutive month obtaining payment, trust this great company, it will not disappoint you,Thanks once again OFP!!
THe real Company is here u are invite to invest sure!!",

"The best Instant funding in the market!

They provide all the neccesary resources to become a funded trader with them, with the best Price-Quiality relation, It is only needed to have a sustainable trading system and follow the previously disclosed rules, the Payouts proces is just as smooth as it can be. Thank OFP",

"I just got my payout with OFP today. Support is great and the dashboard is getting better. I see they are honest and serious about their trading rules. I understand that lot sizes and under 2 minute trade can be a bummer but if you adapt your trading strategy it's all worth it.

Thank you OFP for offering this opportunity for traders.",

"I have been with OFP since last month and just received payout before 2 days. I think I got to know about right company at right time. Also his support team is incredible fast and kind and stick around you until the problem resolved. I have worked with many companies but support team and payout smoothness like this is not experienced yet. I am really grateful and also every trader who is connected with ofp is very luck enough to get to know about this amazing company. Again thank you so much OFP for being real and fast.
At last I would say only one thing that in this industry and if you want instant funding with affordable prices then no one is better than OFP Funding.",

"I have nothing fo Say",

"they always get bad reviews removed by claiming that they cannot find the email, so tread lightly if youre considering purchasing from them.....I am a REAL former user of OFP, I have emails that i have exchanged with support and emails confirming my purchase of your silly prop firm....STOP removing my reviews.

For anyone wanting to use this company do it but understand that if you DECREASE your lot size even by 0.01 depending on your risk management they will terminate your account, I usually trade 0.05, the next wek i traded 0.03 and they suspended my account . support will tell you to guy buy another account. You're better off sticking with one of the better known prop firms..that actually understand how the market works.. OFP seems like a scam, I'm sure some traders are satisfied with it but they are making peanuts compared to what you can make at other prop firms,",

"Estuve en est√° empresa para probar su famoso fondeo inmediato, vi muchas reglas un poco grises y malos comentarios pero quise ver en primera persona, pregunte a soporte sobre la regla de 2 minutos y me dijeron que obteniendo beneficios en menos de 2 minutos por 2 veces en un mes perderias la cuenta, iba corriendo el mes de mayo y a 3 dias de mi cobro me llega un correo de que perdi mi cuenta por est√° regla, veo mi historial y efectivamente tengo 2 operaciones de menos de 2 minutos pero en negativo por lo cual pens√© que era un error y pregunte, me dijeron que la perdia por que el cierre de mis operaciones habia sido manual y ellos aceptan solo perdidas automaticas lo cual me dejo bastante decepcionado ya que a 3 dias de cobro me informan habiendo ocurrido muchos dias antes, pregunte a varias personas y me decian que les ocurria igual, cuando vas en positivo con porcentajes sobre 6% siempre buscar√°n una de sus reglas grises ya sea 2 minutos o gap o lotaje para quitarte tu cuenta, un mes perdido, espero que esta rese√±a les sirva en caso de que quieran entrar con ellos.",

"Es muy real y transparente con todo.. muchas gracias",

"Got a 50k account with ofp and got paid a few times and I breached the 5%ddd , heard some complaints about the dashboard and rules previously but this is happening everywhere in the industry and I decided I tried them once and they are legit so I am gonna try them again with 50k account , instant funding is like nothing else ü§çü§ç",

"My experience is good, I enjoy every moment of my trade all rules are clear except lotsize rule is confusing I wish you could remove this rule could bring in a lot of people to join this company, I will give 5 stars when I get my payout. Thanks",

"Hola, alguien me puede decir si permite dejar un dinero de colch√≥n para proteger cuenta!!!",

"Gracias por el buen servicio!
Los pagos son bien r√°pidos y no hay que preocuparse por fechas, OFP se encarga de recordarlo.",

"I really tanks for ofp. Ofp is save my time to pass phase 1 and phase 2 challenge. And for that i really tanks this propfirm.",

"With ofp you trade with confidence because rules are clears",

"The company needs more development to help traders. You have many mistakes on your website, and also the dashboard is very, very bad, but in terms of credibility, the company is honest so far, but the technical problems are many, unfortunately. I hope they will be addressed as soon as possible.",

"Me encanta que den la oportunidad de no tener que pasar una prueba que te limita a un cierto porcentaje, algunos logramos un porcentaje menor y con este m√©todo de OFP podemos ser rentables.",

"I subscribed to the $25000 account and overall everything is perfect.
Servers are fast, spreads are good, got the account credentials within 6 hours.
The above words was written after I received the account as the company asked me to write a review. then the scamming begins, I placed a sell trade on Gold on June 15 at $1949.7 using 1 lot, that same day it went up to $1959, then the day ended at $1958, so I didn't break the 5% rule, the trade is still open as I'm sure of my analysis, then the next day it went from $1958 to $1967.. still didn't break the 5% rule as it requires to go from $1958 to $1970 in order to break the rule which didn't happen. I left the trade open till next week and gold went down to $1938, I closed the trade in profits and got an email from them that I breached the 5%, the account balance now in my due payment date is $25830 and they stopped the account. kindly stay away.",

"This i a grenat prop firme comptant, i bien following their discord for a while and found them to b√© very active",

"Update 17/5/23 - So as expected gold hit my TP in under two minutes a second time. If you have been watching the gold market lately you know how fast it moves. This was out of my control and is technically considered a violation. I asked support if my account would be suspended without payout and they said they could not tell me right now and to continue trading and the trades will be assessed at the end of this month. For some reason they can't tell me now so I have to continue trading for another two weeks before payout. If I am told they won't payout I will be sure to leave a review here. I have been trading for 15 years with training in the institutional space. Trust pilot won't allow me to post a link to my mql5 account but I can tell you that since i started 2 weeks ago my win rate is >86% with a profit factor of 4, 7.75% growth and max DD of 3%. If the account gets suspended without payout I will be sure to make people aware here, as it can be proven that I am not running any software for HFT / arbitrage and all my trades are manual. Also it would be proof that they are just after subscription fees with no real intention of supporting good traders who are genuinely not "cheating" . Will see what happens in a couple weeks.

2/5/23 - Well it's early days, and I can't fault the prompt responses from support to my queries. Firstly, I'll admit that it's my fault for not reading the rules more closely but there are some things I think people should be aware of. 1. They say they want traders to be good risk managers - fair enough, - but they won't let me use a software that helps me to manage risk - i.e. it calculates the correct lots size and places stops and TPs right away, it also can be programmed to trail positions and take partial profits. An excellent system for managing risk but they won't let me use it - makes zero sense and makes risk management more difficult for me. 2. You can't hold a trade for less than two minutes. I trade gold and S+P a lot and one of my gold trades hit TP in under a minute. I was told that if it happens a second time in a month I will lose the account -and what they don't tell you on the website is that even if you had 10k profit you will not get the pay out because you broke what I consider a soft breach - completely unfair. I understand the 2 minute rule is to stop HFT / arbitrage etc, but for a manual trader who hits TP on gold or another fast instrument in under a minute more than twice a month is not uncommon and its ludicrous to penalise the trader for this and not even agree to a payout if they are in good profit. 3. The 10% stop out trails your highest ever balance so if you have 100k and grow to 200k you stop out level is still a total loss of 10k. They say they don't want people to use more risk because they have more money, but this is ridiculous as surely on 200k you should use double the lot size as 100k as the % risk would still be the same, but you can't do this with them and in this scenario you have to actually reduce your risk as the account grows rather than maintaining the same level of risk. So far it seems to me that they pitch themselves as trustworthy and want traders to succeed but the rules they have in place are highly geared towards making you fail or trade so cautiously that you'll probably only make a small % a month of which you only get 40%. Of course its possible to make more but you would have to use higher risk which dramatically increases the chances of you blowing the account. Lastly, I have a personal account and a few prop accounts and even though they are my own trades which can be proven, I can't copy them across, so I have to manually go into the terminal and set trades separately from all my other accounts - ugh....",

"Plan your and trade your plan. My advice to beginners is discipline on a trading plan because this eliminates feelings of fear and greed while trading because the goal of the trader is to protect the account because you are a risk manager and not a technical or technical analyst. It is enough to work with one strategy and stick to it and review your results every three months and work on it. Performance is to be constant and continuous. This is what I have, and thank you",

"Excelente servicio al cliente y pagos a tiempo sin inconvenientes.",

"Fondeado en demo pero con beneficios y posibilidad de crecer...espero conseguirlo ..gracias por el servicio",

"The support team responds quickly and is enthusiastic. I am having a good experience. Hope to have a long-term cooperation with OFP.",

"Creo que deberian ser mas flexibles con la regla de los 2 minutos, deberian de dar 3 oportunidades en el mes y no menos. Somos seres humanos, no maquinas perfectas y cometemos errores.

Podrian revolucionar mas si la cuenta del 40% la aumentan a 50% para los que ya la tienen y los nuevos clientes que compraran.",

"do not trust the good reviews they are doing that just to get some discount
-You are not alowed to use a risk calculator ea
-you do not trade for 3 days you lose the account
-your trade is below 2 min you lose the account
-you must trade the same lot sizes or you dont have your profit
- there is no dashboard
- your profit split is after a month
If you can be profitable in these condions Be my guest",

"Ofp funding is a good page in the wolrd.",

"Ofp has been transparent and quick in matching me with the right funding program, thier customer service is top notch and i got my account details immediately after payment. I'm very happy with The trading conditions especially the spread. i highly recommend",

"Les doy 4 estrellas est√° genial s√≥lo les comisiones son altas con otros empresas",

"me parce que es muy importante que pregunten a los traders el funcinamiento de la plataforma , de esta manera que pueden mejorar dia a dia",

"I thank a company that gave me a golden opportunity to change",

"A fraud company and its policy is not clear, and when the account is suspended, they limit the profits. I do not recommend it, despite the great publicity on YouTube. When you try, you receive a fraud",

"Tienen un servicio de atenci√≥n al cliente muy bueno",

"great, I'm waiting for my payment",

"Lo que ofrecen es bueno pero lo que es a nivel de acceso a la web y la p√°gina web de lo peor que he visto, much√≠simo que mejorar a nivel operativo.",

"It was easy, 20 hours after i received the credentials",

"This firm is tottly trustable..
I buy this 100k account on 11-04-2023
And still I can‚Äôt face any problems that‚Äôs why i say this is a best firm.",

"El plan de las cuenta supercargadas me parece un robo, tenia una cuenta de 10k, la primera semana hice $910 de profit, la segunda semana viole una regla y pum se quedaron con todo.",

"I have a trading strategy which I trade on my original account, and I contracted this one with them to trade it with Social Trader Tool. They have cancelled my account because they say I am using EA and I am not. I can prove that I do real trading but they preferred to delete my account when they saw that I had real profits.
Be careful with this company",

"Muy contento con la plataforma y la seriedad del todo el equipo",

"The Time for shorts trades scalping fast. Reconsider that",

"A very good company so far. Very low pricing for instant, no evaluation accounts.

The checkout process was very straightforward and I received the account credentials in less than 24 hours.

Their support is very fast (they reply in a few minutes) and always go the extra mile to help.

EDIT: First payout went smootly! Thanks OFP for this huge opportunity of affordable accounts for us traders!

EDIT 2: Just follow the rules, guys. Their 2-minute rule is not a big deal. What serious trader hold positions for less than 2 minutes?",

"Attention : ofp is a scam ‚õî",

"Very good, simple, easy and realistic",

"Through my experience with the funding companies for traders, I believe that OFP has provided something unique, as it offers instant funding at the lowest prices and at the same time, its terms are easy, customer service is very fast and the response takes place within moments, my overall evaluation of the company is excellent, and I hope to continue on the same approach, thank you very much",

"rapid and secure",

"tengo preguntas que nunca fueron leidas, pero lo demas todo bien. es un buen servicio.",

"I do not advise anyone to try this company, a mysterious company, and only a supply that gives you the account, and after that, if you ask to inquire about anything, you will not be answered",

"OFP es una empresa seria y siempre estan cuando los necesitas ,cualquier duda ,aclaracion etc .Nada que ver con otras empresas de fondeo.Muy contento",

"OFP support is fantastic and I have start my work once got withdrawal will update here",

"Only just took on a 100K 40% account.

Read and documented the rules, see how things go.
Website process was easy, took a few hours to get the account details but that was fine as that is what was indicated when I purchased the account.

Update May 24 2023.
Due to my own error I have two accounts suspended, both with the 3 day rule violation. This rule is written very clearly so no issue with the rule being enforced.
Difficult to understand how this rule has anything to do with risk management. Sometimes life gets in the way and it is easy to slip up but somewhat of an expensive experience (100k & 50K accounts).
I manage over 20 accounts so it can be a juggle and I think if your soul focus was on one or two accounts then the 3 day rule would be easy to manage.
Accounts with OFP are affordable and the concept is excellent.

The two minute rule, 3 day rule and even the lot size rules should be reviewed with better flexibility.

If you have put a trade on in error eg wrong lot size, or simply not intended, you should be able to cut the trade and not wait for a minimum of 2 minutes or risk violation.
I don't know how the 2 minute rule works if your stop got taken out within the 2 minutes, this would be rare but best to ask OFP support.

3 day rule can be tricky pending your circumstances but it would be nice if you were given a warning before being disqualified and losing your account and money. Volatility recently has been terrible for FX so quality opportunities have been scarce. Unless you trade crypto on weekends then reality is this is a 3 day over 5 day period rule and not 7 days.

Your focus needs to be on risk management and exposure. You really do not want to be thinking "I better take a trade somewhere today or I am going to lose my account", this does lead to taking trades and risk that you you may otherwise not want to take, you can not take a watered down position of 0.01 to fulfill the 3 day rule, this gets back to the lot size rule.

The lot size can also be tricky, video on the website explains this well but you need to be aware of this.

As per most prop firms the obvious rules are obvious such as daily drawdown and overall drawdown and you only have yourself to blame if you lose an account due to the drawdown but there are always backend rules you must be equally aware of.

In my view you are more likely to get your account suspended on the items mentioned here versus the drawdown limits.

Personally I am unlikely to buy another account with OFP based on the reasons I have mentioned but if you are not juggling lots of accounts then you should be fine with OFP.

Best of luck to the traders and OFP.",

En la regla de d√≠as de negociaci√≥n cuando ya alcanzas el profit semanal mucha gente empezaba a operar al 0.01 para no arriesgar el capital y as√≠ completar los d√≠as de negociaci√≥n pero desde ayer me doy cuenta que ya no se puede hacer eso si no que la modificaron entonces si yo hice eso la semana pasada a esta semana me quitar√≠an mi cuenta por no saber que actualizaron esa regla junto que eliminaron la regla de los gaps , es lo que me preocupa ojal√° que no y que por semanas pasadas de operar as√≠ no perder la cuenta si no apartir de la siguiente semana por qu√© de ser as√≠ muchas personas perder√≠amos nuestras cuentas por no saber que actualizaron esa regla, por favor soporte de ofp funding danos una soluci√≥n
Muchas gracias",

"me parece una plataforma muy buena !!! si quitaran lo de mantener la transaccion 2 minutos seria perfecto.",

"When I first signed up I received my login credentials within 24 hours. However, the broker they use (ICMarkets) has many different options depending what country you are from and what type of account you have. It was very confusing at first. I sent an email to customer support and they immediately helped me through it. They were very detailed and explained that they had already purchased the account so I just needed to sign in on the correct account type. I was logged in and ready to go for the start of the week!

Maybe you could create a very specific instructions with pictures since you have traders from all around the world. And ICMarkets has a lot of different account options.

I would definitely recommend trading with them if you are a consistent trader!",

"Dashboard is not working.",

"The Dashboard is not working I can't follow up on my account on it. when I am doubted I have a chat conversation with the support if I breached the daily maximum loss or not. He assured me that if I didn't receive an email that means I didn't I continued trading till completed the month when I ask to withdraw profit they told me that I did break the maximum daily loss> and they told me the send me an email which I am sure I didn't receive at all",

"Unfortunately bad dashboard, I don't know where I am, I trade like blind. You have to fix it as soon as possible, And also the problem of the lot and the three trading days per week. I find that unrealistic and very annoying. It is not possible to trade in these circumstances. Impossible. I hope those problem will be resolved. Thanks",

"Me gusta Mucho la idea que tiene est√° empresa de fondeo, Siento que es cierto que cuando uno compra un Challenger, casi nunca puedes pasar las 2 fases, con la idea de estar fondeado de inmediato se hace mucho m√°s f√°cil para los trader rentables",

Overall experience is decent for now if not great.",

"Pros: The company is honest in paying

Negatives: The company's trading conditions are so difficult that they trap the trader in order to lose and do not help him to profit
90% of the trading patterns spread among traders are prohibited to them, and this is considered forcing the trader to lose in one way or another",

"Overall experience is good and the support system by admins is really helpful resgarding any querry related to trading",

"Stay away from this company. They‚Äôll create a reason not to pay you. I made profit and they tried to say there‚Äôs a market gap by looking at a 1 minute candle. There‚Äôs no rules about not paying a full amount if there‚Äôs market gaps or not. The market will work how the market will work. What they trying to say was not even a big gap it‚Äôs 0.05 pips on gold. When there‚Äôs no honesty you shouldn‚Äôt put your time and effort like I did for them just to try and scam you out of your money. I spent ¬£746, one month of trading just to realise that they‚Äôre here to scam you not a company that you could trust.",

"OFP is a SCAMMER.
After I gained some profits in my first day they start to manipulate and make the dirty things like untrusted forex brokers. ( freeze the platform - unrealistic move for pairs like gaps or lags in pricing to make you confused - In certain and important levels they stopping the Mt4 to prevent you to enter the trade and this happened with me in three consecutive days) I tried to contact them to solve these issues as a responsible company but they ignored everything and stolen my money. I have all evidences that proof they are scammers ( photos- Videos- Chats with OFP - Emails).
I recommend everyone to go away from this untrusted company.
Regarding to OFP reply: I am a member in OFP

Account Value : 50K
About freezing the platform I do not care If ICMarkets is a trustworthy or not, I know well that Icmarkets is one of the best brokers in the market and I have already account with but how come I can not open trades on your account and in the same time I open trades on my Account in ICmarkets. Is the company has error connection in that server only and all servers is Ok ? How come in certain price levels the platform is stopping and has a connection errors , How come telling me that you have to be patient until ICmarkets solve the issue and if you can not close your trades take it easy and loose your money. How come I sent you emails to compensate me or refund my money because these errors is every day and I can not work in these circumstances. And your reply is it is out of our hand. You can simply review the chat and emails to be sure that there were errors in three consecutive days.",

I am from vietnam and i wish you to be a profitable trader

"I'm following OFP for 1 year now. Extremely trader friendly rules suited for all types of traders. Balance based drawdown which is amazing for swing traders. The 3 minimum days per week trading rule can be a bit annoying but you just have to hold the trades for more than 60 seconds & close it. So it's not a major issue.

Their new 40% profit-split program is the best. If you buy 100K account it's almost same as getting 50K live prop firm account with 80% profit split without passing any challenge at all!

Support staff is also very friendly. I trust the CEO & they give payout to all the profitable traders.",

"Compr√© una cuenta 25k con 25%de beneficios con la cual obtuve profits y al solicitar el pago con la intenci√≥n a posterior de comprar otra cuenta m√°s adelante me hicieron el descuento de forma unilateral y arbitraria pag√°ndome s√≥lo la diferencia en USD y d√°ndome un cup√≥n para canjear por una cuenta de la cual no cuadraba el total , tuve que reclamar que me pagaran todo o me dieran el equivalente total q deber√≠a cubrir ese cup√≥n que se apresuraron para asegurar la venta de otra cuenta; luego me tuve que apurar en cobrar ese cup√≥n ya que con la variaci√≥n del d√≥lar no alcanzar√≠a a cubrir nuevamente el costo de la cuenta siguiente, luego de concretar la transacci√≥n me llegan las claves de la nueva cuenta pero tuve problemas con mi equipo y no pude tradear en simult√°neo con la cuenta original, jam√°s la configur√© ni me conect√© con el servidor del broker para hacer ning√∫n trade, estaba sin activar por ende cuando pudiese mejorar mi equipo pensaba tradear con ambas; a las dos semanas de cobrado el cup√≥n mejoran repartici√≥n de profit de 26% a 40% casi al mismo valor de lo que me descontaron de mis ganancias por lo que estuve una semana preguntando al soporte si pod√≠a pagar la diferencia para aprovechar esa promoci√≥n, no obtuve respuesta jam√°s; sin embargo al completar el mes de canjeada la cuenta me llega un mail nefasto que la nueva cuenta reci√©n recibida hab√≠a ‚Äúviolado la regla de tradear 3 d√≠as semanales‚Äù sin siquiera haberla activado para que comenzara el cron√≥metro de aquella regla, me respondieron por Discord que sus reglas eran al momento de recibir √∫nicamente la contrase√±a y no al elegir cuando activar la cuenta !!!
Por ende me siento absolutamente ESTAFADO , en esta empresa a diferencia de otras no puedes elegir cuando Activar la cuenta , solo por manifestar querer otra cuenta , van y me descuentan inmediatamente el dinero sin pagarme el total y al tener que apurarme en activar el cup√≥n ya estaba con la presi√≥n de tener que iniciar tradear inmediatamente.
La manipulaci√≥n de esta empresa te lleva a consumir r√°pido la cuenta para que la pierdas lo antes posible
Jam√°s digan que tienes ganas a futuro de comprar otra cuenta ya que te la descontar√°n sin asco inmediatamente para asegurar sus ganancias y te ver√°s forzado a tradear a penas te manden las claves.Si me Hubiesen pagado el total de profits hubiese podido aprovechar la mejora de 40% y no hubiese tenido la presi√≥n de operar apenas me llegaran las claves.

Esto no sucede en otras compa√±√≠as donde te pagan todo y puedes elegir cuando activar tu cuenta para que corra el historial
Muy mala experiencia , me siento absolutamente enga√±ado y presionado por sus condiciones que no son advertidas en las reglas de la web de forma clara.

Respuesta al descargo de OFP:

Aqu√≠ tengo la prueba de que si descontaron el pago inmediatamente d√°ndome un ‚Äúcup√≥n‚Äù para cobrar por otra cuenta inmediatamente sin haberles confirmado cuando quer√≠a a futuro comprar otra cuenta‚Ä¶

Hi Cristian,
Your payout is 218.18$, enough to cover the price of a discounted 25K USD account which is 206.69. We converted your full payout into a coupon valid on any purchase, the rest of the money will be sent to your PayPal.
Discount code: QPVTS3HV
Best,
OFP Team

Lamentablemente no puedo subir la captura de pantalla del mail pero ah√≠ queda reflejado el accionar de OFP donde ‚Äúaseguraron‚Äù una venta que deb√≠a cobrar antes de q variara el d√≥lar tal como pas√≥‚Ä¶

////////////////
Hi,
Please notice that 171.9 GBP equals 206.91 USD.
That's the correct amount for a 25K USD account with a 10% discount, you did not apply the discount in time.
I will change the coupon to cover the 10% discount you missed.

Coupon: NFCEMTGE

Best,
OFP Team
///////////////////
En la segunda instancia pude activar el cup√≥n enviado que cubr√≠a la cuenta de 25k con 26%
Pero jam√°s indicaron que deb√≠a usarla inmediatamente porque se me anular√≠a por incumplimiento.
Es una empresa que tiene muchas reglas pero poca TRANSPARENCIA en sus pagos y de c√≥mo los aplica ANTES de que les compres una cuenta.
Por ende , CONSEJO: No comprar una cuenta en OFP si quieres tradear a posterior ya que te aplican todo el peso de sus reglas poco claras
En MFF y TradersCentral puedes activar cuando t√∫ lo decidas configurar y conectarte al broker y no perder√°s la cuenta por algo distinto que no manejar tu riesgo , que es lo deber√≠a imperar en este tipo de empresas que ya te colocan bastantes dificultades de gesti√≥n diaria y mensual .
Y todo lo que aqu√≠ est√° escrito es la ABSOLUTA VERDAD aunque OFP me quiera desmentir",

First, the rules of their platform are great for learning good and consistent trading. They provide many educational resources which help me to properly understand market trends and insights.

Second, their instant funding program is awesome and is reasonably priced compared to other firms in the industry. It allows me to move swiftly in any market situation, no matter what time of day or night it is.

Finally, their friendly support team really stands out above others - special kudos to Vaino who offers practical advise and answers my queries promptly. He always made sure that I'm comfortable with my trades before proceeding forward.

"forgot to mentioned few things about this firm, they have so many hidden policy to scam traders, their rules r not crystal clear, and not all acc breached related rules mentioned in same section, Thye spread their tricky rules under different section which are not relevant as well. like prohibited trading:
""

We welcome all trading styles that can be replicated in Live market conditions. Trading styles that are deemed as ‚ÄúCheating‚Äù on demo accounts are not permitted. Below is a list of styles prohibited within our program: Gap trading, latency arbitrage, long-short arbitrage, reverse arbitrage, reverse/opposite account trading, hedging, Tick scalping/trading, Martingale Trading and news straddling methods. Although this list does not include all tactics that can violate our trading policies, these are the most frequent ones we have observed traders trying to take advantage of demo accounts. If any account is seen to be using unfair strategies or an unrealistic trading style their account will be suspended.""

means they have so many hidden rules may apply when needed to scam.

after asking for more details:

this is simple no idea what is more u asked for, if u cant mentioned ur prohibated rules which rules trader will follow? u named few than mentioned that there r more? how to know which r eligible which r not?

to reply of ofp response:

dont fabricated ur scam as my frustration, u cheated with me and i submitted all the proof to trust pilot, if my claim was wrong then they will remove the review, which wasn't happened, so dont try to fool other by using false statements. yes every trusted / reliable prop firm mentioned prohibited trading rules specifically . only those are scam firm they dont mentioned specifically, and use words like urs.",

"I am in several telegram groups and so far I only read good things, and they comply with the payments, which is one of the most important things",

"Very poor experience. I simply used a risk managment tool and shared it with the support. They bannded my account because for them a risk managment tool is a EA like any other EA, without even checking it. So I had no chance of a discount or second chance or even explanation. Really bad support and it has a bad smell, too. Stay away!",

"This prop firm is really amazing I'm so excited to work with them , thanks ofp to give me the chance to become successful in my life and reach the financial freedom",

"OFP is a great prop firm for all traders!
I started trading with them late last year (2021) and the service has consistently been treating me well.
The support team is approachable and responds to any queries within a few moments on all platforms including email.
Trading with OFP is an investment that yields considarable returns when you follow the rules!",

"thats a great company ..
thanks OFP",

"It was my first account. I understood daily loss limit wrong. I thought it works same as other company's which means it resets every day, but it is different, when you book some profits intraday daily loss limit go up. So my loss limit was taken higher 84aud and I hit loss limit by 23aud (limit daily was 1250). The rule is :

"Your equity and balance must not be less or equal than your daily maximum balance minus the account margin. The account margin is 5% of your initial deposit balance. Each day is considered to be starting from midnight GMT +0."

Anyway after I reached support i understood mistake.

I asked support can my account be bring back, but no response for my last 2 emails. So it means for me they do not care, money taken no more problem.

Other thing to consider is company got reward program and they pay points for sharing in social media and good reviews on trust pilot, so now I understand why so many good short reviews.

The only good thing is ic markets demo.",

Payments and withdrawals are effective and ultra fast. frankly I highly recommend it. Big up to OFP. Thanks to you my goals are and will be achieved. Because I've always been a good trader but I didn't have the capital to get started. Thanks to OFP it's done. Today my dream is coming true",

"Mi amigo me mostr√≥ un pago de ellos y que realmente les da la oportunidad a los traders que son RENTABLES a capitalizarse con OFP.

Los veo con mucho futuro, su tasa alta de pagos a los traders habla muy bien de ellos. No son como el resto de las otras compa√±√≠as que quieren que ingreses para PERDER dinero.

SI SOS RENTABLE, EST√ÅS EN EL LUGAR INDICADO.",

I give 5 plus starts for there customer service , they always get back to you at a timely manner . Overall a great program",

"Horrendous prop firm, designed by traders to rob other traders.
I got paid out but wish I'd have just blown the account.
They take the lions share, deem trades as gambling when they aren't, when I was on week 3 my account balance was 27500 and I'd made profit but because they decided some trades were gambling (they weren't they just can't understand that lot size and stop loss are correlated) they took money away from previous profits however this did not reflect on screen on my mt4, the balance remained the same.
It is completely disgusting to penalise a trader 40% of his previous profits on the final week, you already make enough out of us why be so greedy? Not designed for traders to win, stick to my forex funds or FTMO.
Only positive is Admin Vaino, great guy v helpful.",

"Hola
La Paz del Se√±or est√© con ustedes

La experiencia de pago fue satisfactoria, pague con Visa y todo bien, a breves minutos recib√≠ por email los datos para conectarme a la plataforma MT4.

"I think Overview funding program is one of the best program in the industry but the only thing I dislike about this firm is the daily drawdown limit which doesn't increases with your profit for that day.

It's a standard rule followed by every prop firm that the daily loss limit increases along with the generated profit for that day.

I hope they will come up with something which attracts more traders.",

I always got swift replies from him and I‚Äôm so thankful for him for reassuring me with a couple of things. Here‚Äôs to moreee ü§©ü§©ü§©

P.S I never ever leave reviews on any websites but this was so damn worth it so I couldn‚Äôt not comment on it üòÜ",

"I make profit and OFP paid 5k of my profit then I invite my others 3 friend to join , after a week 2 of them make huge profit i.e 11k usd and 13k usd which should entitled 25% of their profit . OFP accused we are same person and banned us as requested reason given:
1) Same Trades
2) Same SL Amount
3) Same Nationality
4)Same 1st Strategy
5) Same Lot Size
6) Same Pair
7)Same Style

We reply that we trade separately and the reason our trade style Same because we learned same technique and from Same Guru. Their rules doesn't stated this is not allow . Furthermore , our trade entry point and time are NOT SAME at all and they call us cheater by accusing we do copy trade assume /suspect 1 trader provide signal but Most important thing is all our trades are totally Different Entry Point /Different TP point / Different Entry Point so how this call as copy trade &signal provide.
With regards to Same SL Amount because unnder this programme max DD is 5% so some our trade set to 4% or max 4.5% under 5% which doesn't break any rule , ditto lotsize .
All evidence included Email between OFP is available and will be provided to Trustpilot upon request
The way OFP handling this case is very unprofessional even they know we are not same person and they just use their term & condition as excuses not pay us and banned us without refund just based on their assumption and suspicious four of us are same inviduals which we could jusyify by KYC we are four different individuals but they refuse consider our request.
They even stated I already can make 20k profit (5kusd payout), so not suitable to their program and this is not stated at their T&C .",
